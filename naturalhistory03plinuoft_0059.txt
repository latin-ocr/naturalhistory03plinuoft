creature’s great ferocity abating in an almost in-
credible manner when its head is covered with even
a light wrap, with the result that it is vanquished
without showing sight. The fact is that all its strength
is concentrated in its eyes, which makes it less
remarkable that when Lysimachus by order of
Alexander was shut up in a lion's cage he succeeded
in strangling it. Mark Antony broke lions to the
yoke and was the first person at Rome to harness
them to a chariot, and this in fact during the civil
war, after the decisive battlea in the plains of Phar-

position of affairs, the portentous feat signifying that
generous spirits can bow to a yoke. For his riding
in this fashion with the actress Cytheris at his side
was a thing that outdid even the portentous occur-
rences of that disastrous period. It is recorded that
Hanno, one of the most distinguished of the Cartha-
ginians, was the first human being who dared to
handle a lion and exhibit it as tamed, and that this
supplied a reason for his impeachment‚ because it
was felt that a man of such an artful character
might persuade the public to anything, and that
their liberty was ill entrusted to one to whom even
ferocity had so completely submitted.

But there are also instances of occasional merciful-
ness even in lions. The Syracusan Mentor in Syria
met a lion that rolled on the ground in suppliant
wise and struck such terror into him that he was
running away, when the lion stood in his way wherever
he turned, and licked his footsteps as if fawning
on him3 he noticed a swelling and a wound in its
foot, and by pulling out a thorn set the creature
free from torment: a picture at Syracuse is evidence
