XVI. There has been a great deal of minute
enquiry among the learned as to the manner in
which bees reproduce their species; for sexual
intercourse among them has never been observed.
A majority of authorities have held the view that
the offspring are formed in the mouth, by blending
together blossoms of the reed and the olive; some
think it is by copulation with a single male which in
each swarm is called the king3 and that this is the
only male, and is of exceptional size, so as not to
grow weary3 and that consequently offspring is not
produced without him, and the rest of the bees
accompany him as women accompany a husband,

drones; for what reason can there be why the same
act of union should engender some perfect offspring
and others imperfect? The former opinion would
be nearer to the truth, were it not that again another
difficulty meets us z it is a fact that sometimes larger
bees are born in the extremities of the combs which

fact is that they sit on their eggs in the way that hens
do. The offspring hatched at first looks likea white
maggot, lying crosswise and sticking so closely to
the wax that it seems to be part of it. The king is
from the start of the colour of honey, as if made
from a special blossom chosen out of the whole
supply, and is not a maggot but has wings from the
start. The remaining throng when they begin to
take shape are called pupae, while the sham ones α are
called sirens or drones. If anybody takes the heads
