it is in the mouth and serves as a tongue. With
some these stings are blunt, and do not serve for
pricking but for suction—for instance with a sort of
fly, in which the tongue is evidently a tube3 and this
sort of insect have no teeth. Others, for instance
butterflies, have useless little horns projecting in
front of their eyes. Some insects, for instance the
centipede, have no wings.

XXXV. Insects that have feet can move sideways.
Ofsome, for instance locusts, the hind feet are longer
and curve outward.

Locusts in the autumn season give birth to clusters
of eggs, by lowering the tube of the prickle to the
earth. The eggs last for the winter, but in the ensuing
year at the end of spring send out small insects, that
are blackish and have no legs. and crawl with their
wing-feathers. Consequently spring rains kill the
eggs, whereas in a dry spring there are larger broods.
Others record that they have two breeding seasons
and two seasons when they die off—bearing at the
rise of the Pleiads and then dying at the rise of the
Dogstar, others being born in their place3 some say
that this second brood is born at the setting of
Arcturus. It is certain that the mothers die when
they have given birth to a brood, a maggot
immediately forming inside them in the region of
the throat that chokes them. The males die at the
same time. And although dying for such a trifling
reason a single locust when it likes can kill a snake
by gripping its throat with its teeth. They are born
only in places with chinks in them. There are said
to be locusts in India three feet long, with legs
and thighs that when they have been dried can be
used as saWS. They also have another way of dying:
