the animals that do not get fat have hard bones3
those of asses are resonant enough to use as flutes.
Dolphins being viviparous have bones and not spines,
but snakes have spines. Soft aquatic species have no
bones, but rings of flesh bound round the body, for
instance the two kinds of cuttle-fish. Insects also
are said to be equally devoid of bones. The gristly
aquatic species have marrow in the spine, and seals
have gristle, not bones. Similarly with all that have
ears and nostrils that just project these are soft and
flexible‚ nature thus insuring them against fracture.
When gristle is burst it does not join up, and when
bones are amputated they do not grow again, except
the bone between the hoof and the hock in beasts of
burden. Human beings grow taller to the age of
twenty—one and from then onward fill out; but more
particularly at the period of puberty they are noticed
to get free from a sort ofimpediment to their growth,
and especially so in sickness.

LXXXVIII. The sinews starting from the heart, The sinews.
and in the ox actually wrapped C>round the beart,
have a similar nature and explanation, being in all
animals attached to the slippery bones and binding
together the links of the bodily frame called joints,
in some cases by coming between them‚' in others by
surrounding them and in others by passing from one
to another, being at one point rounded and at another
flattened as the conformation of the joint requires
in each case. The sinews also do not join again if cut,
and, what is surprising, though extremely painful if
wounded cause no pain at all if cut through. Some
animals, for instance fishes‚ have no sinews, as they
are held together by their arteries; although the
soft speciesa of the fish genus lack arteries as well.
