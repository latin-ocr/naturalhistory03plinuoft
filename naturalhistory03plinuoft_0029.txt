they are devoid of strong affection, for it is re-
ported that one elephant 1n Eo gypt fell ln love with a
girl who was selling flow,ers and (that nobody may
think that it was a vulgar choice) who was a remark-
able favourite of the very celebrated scholar Aris-
tophanes 3 and another elephant is said to have fallen
in love with a young soldier in Ptolemy's army, a
Syracusan named Menander, and whenever it did
not see him to have shown its longing for him by
refusing food. Also J uba records a girl selling scent
who was loved by an elephant. In& all these cases
the animals showed their affection by their delight
at the sight of the object and their clumsy gestures
of endearment, and by keeping the branches given
to them by the public and showering them in the
loved one’s lap. Nor is it surprising that animals
possessing memory are also capable of affection.
For the same writer records a case of an elephant's
recognizing many years later in old age a man who
had been its mahout in its youth, and also an instance
of a sort of insight into justice, when King Bocchus
ticd to stakes thirty elephants which he intended to
punish and exposed them to a herd of the same
number men iunning out among them to plov ok e
them to the attack, and it proved impossible to make
them perform the service of ministering to another' s
cruelt .

V Lyltaly saw elephants for the first time in the

oxen because they were seen in Lucania, 280⁰ B.c.
but Rome first saw them at a date five years later,
in a triumph, and also a very large number that were
captured from the Carthaginians in Sicily by the
victory of the pontiff Lucius Metellus, 252 Bc.
