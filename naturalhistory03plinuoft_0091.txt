its conqueror, it stanches the poisonous infection

XLII. There are thousands of points besides, Animalsehat

inasmuch as Nature has likewise also bestowed upon Ξῗεῗῗιῖἷνδιᾶεέθ
very many animals the faculty of observing the sky, «tamer.
and a variety of different modes of prognosticating
winds, rain and stoi-ms, a subject which it would be

an immense task to pursue‚ just as much so no doubt

as the other points of alliance between particular
animals and human beings. For in fact animals even

give warning of dangers in advance‚ not only by
means of their entrails and internal organs, a thing

that much intrigues a great part of mankind, but also

by another mode of indication. When the collapse

of a building is imminent, the mice migrate in ad-
vance‚ and spiders with their webs are the first things

to fall. Indeed auguries have constituted a science

at Rome and have given rise to a priestly college of

the greatest dignity. In frostbound countries the

fox also is among the creaturos believed to give
omens, being an animal of formidable sagacity in
other respects; people only cross frozen rivers and
lakes at points where it goes or returns: it has been
observed to put its ear to the frozen surface and to
guess the thickness of the ice. XLIII. Nor are Destfuaive
there less remarkable instances of destructiveness ⁸pe⁶²⁸⁸‘
even in the case of contemptible animals. Marcus
Varro states that a town in Spain was undermined

by rabbits and one in Thessaly by moles, and that

a tribe in Gaul was put to ssight by frogs and one in
Africa by locusts, and the inhabitants were banished

from the island of Gyara in the Cyclades by mice‚

and Amynclae in Italy was completely destroyed
