this to sing with, as we shall say.‘² For the rest, there
is nothing on the belly. When they are disturbed
and fly away, they give out moisture‚ which is the
only proof that they live on dew3 moreover they are
the only creatures that have no apel-ture for the
bodily excreta. Their eyes are so dim that if any-
body comes near to thern contracting and straighten-
ing out 3 finger, they pass by as if it were a leaf
flickering. Some people make two other classes of
tree-crickets‚ the twig·cricket which is the larger,
and the corn-ericket, which others call the oat-cricket‚
because it appears at the same time as the crops
begin to dry. Tree-crickets do not occur where trees
are scarce—consequently they are not found at
Cyrenae except in the neighbourhood of the town—
nor in plains or in chilly or shady woods. These
creatures also make some difference between locali—
ties3 in the district of Miletus they occur in few
places, but there is 3 river in Cephallania which makes
3 boundary with a few of thern on one side and many
on the other3 again in the Reggio territory they are
all silent but beyond the river in the region of Locri
they sing. They have the same wing-structure as
bees, but larger in proportion to the body.

XXXIII. Of insects some have two wings‚ for stmfcture os
instance, flies‚ and some four, for instance bees. 2322&
The tree-cricket also flies with its membranes.
Those armed with a sting in the belly have four wings‚
but none having 3 weaponin the mouth has more than
two wings to fly with, for the former have this weapon
bestowed on them for the sake of vengeance but the
latter for the purpose of greed. No inseets’ wings
when torn off grow again. None that has 3 sting in
the belly is two-winged.
