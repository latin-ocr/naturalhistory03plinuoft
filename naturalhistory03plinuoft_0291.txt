of the equinox; soft fish in the spring3 the cuttle-
fish in all the months—its eggs stiek together with
an inky gum like a bunch of grapes, and the male
directs his breath upon them, otherwise they are
barren. Polyps mate in winter and lay eggs in
spring that cluster in a twisting coil; and they are
so prolific that when they are killed the cavity of
their head will not hold the multitude of eggs that
they carried in it when pregnant. T hey lay them
after seven weeks, many of them perishing because
of their number. Langoustes and the rest of the
speeies with rather thin shells deposit their eggs
underneath them and so hatch them3 the female
polyp now sits on the eggs and now forms a closed
eavern with her tentacles intertwined in a lattice.
The sepia lays on land among reeds or wherever
there is seaweed growing, and hatehes after a fort·
night. The euttle-fish produces its eggs in deep
water clustered together like those of the sepia.
The purple-fish, the murex and their kind spawn
in spring. Sea-urchins have eggs at the full moons
in winter, and snails are born in the winter time.

LXXV. The electrie ray is found having broods Reproductzon
numbering eighty3 also it produces exeeedingly 230¹?ng
small eggs inside it, shifting them to another part offiff·
the womb and emitting them there; and similarly
all the speeies that we have designateda cartilaginous :
thus it comes about that these are the only fish
kinds that are both viviparous and oviparous.
With the catfish alone of all species the male
guards the eggs, often for as long as 50 days at
a time, to prevent their being eaten by other fish.
The females of all the other species spawn in three
days if a male has touched them.
