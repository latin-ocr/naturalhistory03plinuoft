though thenceforward the horns grow again like the
old ones and the age cannot be told by them. But
old age is indicated by the teeth‚ for the old have
either few or none, nor have they tines at the bottom
of the horus, though otherwise these usually jut out
in front of the brow when they are younger. When
stags have been gelt the horris do not fall off nor grow
again, but burst out with excrescences that keep
springing again, at first resembling dry skin‚ and
then grow up with tender shoots into reedy tufts
feathered with soft down. As long as the stags are
without them, they go out to graze in the nights.
When they are growing again they harden them with
the heat of the sun, subsequently testing them on
trees, and only go out into the open when satisfied
with their strength; and before now they have
been caught with green ivy on their antlers‚ that has
been grafted on the tender horns as on a log of wood
as a result of rubbing them against trees while testing
them. Stags are sometimes even of a white colour,
as Quintus Sertorius’s hind is said to have been,
which he had persuaded the tribes of Spain to believe
prophetie. Even stags are at war with a snake;
they track out their holes and draw them out by
means of the breath of their nostrils in spite of their
resistance. Consequently the smell made by burn-
ing stag’s horn is an outstanding thing for driving
away serpents, while a sovereign cure against bites
is obtained from the rennet of a fawn killed in its
mother’s womb. Stags admittedly have a long life,
some having been caught a hundred years later with
the gold necklaces that Alexander the Great had
put on them already covered up by the hide in great
folds of fat. This animal is not liable to severish dis-
