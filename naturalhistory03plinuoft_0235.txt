called soft fish‚ then those covered with thin rinds,
and lastly those enclosed in hard shells. The soft
are the cuttle-fish‚ the sepia, the polyp and the others
of that kind. They have the head between the feet
and the belly, and all of them have eight little feet.
In the sepia and cuttle—fish two of these feet are
