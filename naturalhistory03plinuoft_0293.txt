LXXVI. The hornfish or garfish is the only fish

so prolific that its matrix is ruptured when it spawns ;
after spawning the wound grows together, which is
said to happen in the case of blindworms also. The
sea-mouse digs a trench in the ground to lay its eggs
in and covers it again with earth, and a month later
digs the earth up again and opens the trench and
leads its brood into the water.

LXXVII. The red mullet and the sea-perch a are
said to have wombs. The species called by the Greeks
hoop-fish ὁ is said to practise self-impregnation. The
offspring of all aquatic animals are blind at birth.

LXXVIII. There has recently been sent to us a
remarkable case of longevity in fishes. In Campania
not far from Naples, there is a country house named
Posilipo ⁶3 Annaeus Seneca writes that in Caesar's
fishponds on this property a fish thrown in by Polio
Vedius had died after reaching the age of 60, while
two others of the same breed that were of the same
age were even then living. The mention of fishponds
reminds me to say a little more on this topic before
leaving the subject of aquatic animals.

LXXIX. Oyster ponds were first invented by CH ure

Sergius Orata on the Gulf of Baiae, in the time of
the orator Lucius Crassus, before the Marsian wal-‘st
his motive was not greed but avarice, and he made a
great profit out of his practical ingenuity, as he was
the first inventor of showerbaths——he used to fit out
country houses in this way and then sell them. He
was the first to adjudge the best flavour to Lucrine
oysters—because the same kinds of fish are of better
quality in different places, for example wolf-fish in the
Tiber between the two bridges θ, turbot at Ravenna,
lamprey in Sicily, sturgeon at Rhodes, and other kinds
