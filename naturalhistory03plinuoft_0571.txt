BOOK XI. Lxxv. 194-LXXV1L 197

(Animals in the Pontus that eat wormwood are
free from bile.) Again the gall-bladder is connected
with the kidneys and only on one side with the
intestine in ravens, quails and pheasants, and in some
only with the intestine, as in pigeons, the hawk,
lampreys3 and with a few birds it is in the liver.
With snakes it is proportionally extremely copious,
and so with fishes. But with birds it usually fills the
whole intestine, as with the hawk and kite ; moreover
it is also in the liver, as in the case of all the large
marine animals. Indeed in the case of seals it is in
high repute sor many purposes as well. From bulls'
gall a golden colour is extracted. The augurs have
consecrated the gall to Neptune and the power of
the watery element, and the late lamented Augustus
found a double gall-bladder on the day on which he
won the battle of Actiumfl

LXXVI. It is said that the filaments in the tiny Theziver.
livers of mice correspond with the number of the
days of the moon in the month, and are found to
correspond with its degree of light3 and also that
theye, <riou larger with winter. wRabbits are often
found0 in Southern Spain with a double set of in-
ternal organs. One of the two filaments of toads
ants do not touch, because of their poison, as is
believed. The liver is extremely capable of enduring
age, and has been proved by instances of sieges ὸ to
last a hund1 ed years

LXXVII. Snakes and lizards have long internal Οζὴθ*
organs. There is a record that when a person ato
V olterra named Caecina was performing a sacrifice,
some snakes darted out from the internal organs of
the victim—a joyful portent3 and indeed itU would
seem nothing incredible to those considering that on

erno!
