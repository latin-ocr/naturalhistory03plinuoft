red and white. When dead it is of a pallid colour.
It has flesh on the head and jaws and at the junction
of the tail in a rather scanty amount, and nowhere
else in the whole body; blood in the heart and
around the eyes only; its vital parts contain no
spleen. It hibernates like a lizard in the winter
months.

LII. The reindeer of Scythia also changes its

colours, but none other of the fur-clad animals does c
so except the Indian wolf, which is reported to have 00 θα

a mane on the neck. For the jackal—which is a kind
of wolf, longer in the body and differing in the
shortness of the legs, quick in its spring, living by
hunting, harmless to man—changes its raiment
though not its colom, being shaggy through the
winter but naked in summer. The reindeer is the
size of an ox3 its head is larger than that of a stag
but not unlike it3 it has branching horns, cloven
hooves‚ and a fleece as shaggy as a bear’s but, when
it happens to be self-coloured, resembling an ass's
coat. The hide is so hard that they use it for making
cuirasses. When alarmed it imitates the colours of
all the trees, bushes and flowers and places where it
lurks‚⁰ and consequently is rarely caught. It would
be surprising that its body has such variety of charac-
ter, but it is more surprising that even its fleece has.

LIII. The porcupine is a native of India and Africa.
It is covered with a prickly skin of the hedgehogs’
kind, but the spines of the porcupine are longer and
they dart out when it draws the skin tight: it pierces
the mouths of hounds when they close with it, and
shoots out at them when further off. In the winter
months it hibemates, as is the nature of many animals
and before all of bears.
