BOOK XI. xc1v. 231-XCV. 234

Boiling oxhide produces glue; bull’s hide makes
the best.

XCV. Man is the only species in which the male Phela cti·
has teats3 with the rest of the animals there are only 09,οῑξῇ
the marks of teats. But with the females also only
those have teats on the breast that are able to lift
their offspring up to them. No oviparous species has
teats; and only the viviparous have milk. Among
flying species only the bat has milk, as I think the
story about screech-owls, that they drop milk from
their teats into the mouths of babies, is a fabrication.
It is an ackowledged fact that even in old days the
screech-owl was one of the creatures under a curse,
but what particular bird is meant I believe to be
uncertain.

With asses the teats are painful after foaling‚ and
consequently they refuse to suckle their foals after
five months, whereas mares give suck almost a
whole year. VVhole-hooved species that never have
more than two foals all have two dugs, and these
always between the thighs. Animals with cloven
feet and horns have the dugs in the sanie place,
cows having four and sheep and goats two. Those
that bear large litters and that have toes on the
feet have more dugs, and these in a double row the
whole length of the belly-—for instance swine, of
which the good breeds have twelve dugs and the
common ones two less3 similarly with dogs. Some
Species have four dugs in the middle of the belly,
for instance leopards, others two, for instance
lionesses. The elephant has only two dugs be-
neath the shoulders and not on the breast but close
to it, concealed under the shoulder-blades. None
of the species with toes have dugs beneath the thighs.
