buried beneath the litter of antiquity! Here on a
trifling matter connected with our own country-
houses, a thing constantly in evidence, there is no
agreement among the authorities—the question
whether the king bee alone has no sting and is
armed only with the grandeur of his office, or whether
nature has indeed bestowed one upon him but has
merely denied him the use of it. It is a well
established fact that the ruler does not use a sting.
The commons surround him with a marvellous
obedience. When he goes in procession‚ the whole
swarm accompanies him and is massed around him
to encircle and protect him, not allowing him to be
seen. During the rest of the time, while the people
are engaged in labour, he himself goes the circuit
of the works inside, with the appearance of
urging them on, while he alone is free from duty.
He is surrounded by certain retainers and lictors as
the constant guardians of his authority. He only
issues abroad when the swarm is about to migrate3
intelligence of this is given long before, as a buzzing
noise has been going on for some days in the hive, a
sign of their preparation while they are selecting a
suitable day. If anybody should cut off one of his
wings, the swarm would not run away. When they
have started. each one wants to be next him and
delights to be seen on duty3 when he is tired they
support him with their shoulders, and carry him
entirely if he is more completely exhausted. Any
bee that falls out from weariness or happens to stray
from the main body, follows on by scent. WVherever
the king alights is the camping place of the whole
body.
