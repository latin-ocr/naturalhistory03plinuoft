females are fiercer when with young, and this is more
or less the same in every kind of wild animal. Male
boars do not mate till one year old. In India they
have curved tusks 18 in. long: two project from the
jaw, and two from the forehead like a calf’s horns.
The wild boar’s hair is a sort of copper colour; that
offthe other species is black. But the hog genus does
not occur in Arabia.

LXXIX. In the 6356 of no other kind of animal is
it so easy to cross with the wild variety ; the offspring
of such unions in old days were called ‘hybrids,’
meaning half-wild, a term also applied as a nickname
to human beings‚ for instance, to Cicero⁷s colleague in
the consulship ,α Gaius Α1110111115.ὸ But not only in pigs
but in all 3111111315 35 well whenever there is any tame
variety of a genus there is also found a wild one of the
same genus, inasmuch as even in the case of man an
equa] number of savage races have been predicted
to exist. Nevertheless the formation of the goat is
transferred to a very large number of similar species ε
there are the goat, the chamois and the ibex—an
animal of marvellous speed, although its head is
burdened with enormous horns resembling the
sheaths of swords, towards which it sways itself as
though whirled with a sort of catapult, chiefly when
on rocks and secking to leap from one crag to another,
and by means of the recoil leaps out more nimbly
to the point to which it wants 10 get. There are
also the oryx, the only species according to certain
authorities clothed with hair lying the wrong way,
towards the head, and the antelope, the white-rumped
antelope, the twisted-horn antelope and a great
many other not dissimilar species. ’ Β111 1116 former⁶
