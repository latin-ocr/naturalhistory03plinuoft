well. At this stage no sort of bird will compare with
a young cuckoo for savoury flavour.

XII. Kites belong to the same genus as hawks
but differ in size. It has been noticed in regal-d to
this species that though a most rapacious bird and
always hungry it never steals any edible from the
oblations at funerals nor from the altar at Olympia
and not even out of the hands of the people bringing
the offsprings except with a gloomy portent for
the slaves performing the sacrifice. Also it seems
that this bird by its manipulation of its tail taught
the art of steersrnanship‚ nature demonstrating in
the sky what was required in the deep. Kites thern-
selves also are not seen in the winter months, though
not departing before the swallow3 it is reported
however that they suffer from gout even from
midsummer onward.

XIII. The primary distinction between birds is
established especially by the feet3 for either they
have hooked talons or claws or they are in the web-
footed class like geese and water-fowl generally.
If they have hooked talons they live for the most part
only on flesh3 (XIV) though crows α eat other food as
well, as if a nutis so hard that it resists their beak they
fly up alost and drop it two or more times on to rocks or
roos-tiles, till it is cracked and they can break it open.
The bird itself has a persistent croak that is unlucky,
although some people speak well of it. It is noticed
that from the rising of Arcturus to the arrival of the
swallows it is rarely seen in groves and temples of
Minerva and never at all elsewhere, as is the case at
Athens3 it is most unlucky at its breeding season,
that is, after midsummer. Moreover this bird alone
