must and olive oil—it is called honey—vinegar—is the
most commendable. All summer honey is reddish,
as it has been made in a comparatively dry period.
White honey is not made where there is thyme, but
honey made from thyme is thought most suitable for
the eyes and for ulcers—it is of a gold colour and has
an extremely agreeable taste. The fat honey from
violets and the thick kind from rosemary can be seen
to condense, but honey that thickens is least
praised. Honey from thyme does not condense, and
when touched sends out very thin threads, which is
the first proof of goodness3 it is considered a mark
of poor quality for the drops to break off at once and
fall back. The next test is for it to have a fragrant
scent and a sweet taste leaving a tang, and to be
sticky and transparent. Cassius Dionysius holds that
a tenth part of the summer honey-crop should be left
to the bees, if the hives were full, and that if they
were not, a proportionate amount should be left,
or if they were empty, they should not be touched
at all. The population of Attica have given the
first ripening of the wild fig α as the signal for this
vintage, but others say Vulcan's holy day.⁶

A third, very little valued, kind of honey is wild
honey, called heath—honey. It is collected after
the first autumn rains, when only the heath is in
flower in the woods, and consequently it resembles
sandy honey. It is produced mostly by the rise of
Arcturus after September 12. Some people advance
the summer honey-making to the rise of Arcturus,
since that leaves fourteen days to the autumnal
equinox, and in the forty-eight days from the
equinox to the setting of the Pleiads heath is most
plentiful. The Athenian name for it is tetralice, and
