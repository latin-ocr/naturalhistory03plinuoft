preserved in the temple of Sancus; and also in the-
shrine of Fortune a pleated royal robe made by her,
which had been worn by Servius Tullius. Hence
arose the practice that maidens at their marri acre were
aecompanied by a decorated distaff and a spindle with
thlead. Tanaquil first wove a straight tunic of the
kind that novices wear with the plain white toga,
and newly married brides. The pleated robe was
the first among those most in favour3 consequently
the spotted robe went out of fashion. Fenestella
writes that togas of smooth eloth and of Phryxian
wool began in the latest times of the late lamented
Augustus. Togas of closely woven poppy-cloth have a
an older source, being noticed as far back as the poet
Lucilius in the case of Torquatus. Bordercd robes
found their origin with the Etruscans. I find it
recorded that striped robes were worn by the kings,
and they had embroidered robes as far back as
Homer,b these being the origin of those worn in
triumphs. Embroidering with the needle was dis-
covered by the Phrygians, and consequently em-
broidered robes are called Phrygian. Gold em·
broidery was also invented m Asia, by King Attalus,
from whom Attalic robes got their name. OWeaving
different colours into a pattern was chiefly brought
into vogue by Babylon, which gave its name to this
process. But the fabric called damask woven with
3 number of threads was introduced by Alexandria,
and check patterns by Gaul. Metellus Scipio
counts it among the charges against Capito that
Babylonian coverlets were already then sold for
