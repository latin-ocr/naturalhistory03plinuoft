BOOK X. xxxvm. 74—XL1. 77

This is the latest of the migratory birds admitted to
the menu, because of its unpleasant pungent flavour3
but the Tomb of Meleager has made it famous.

XXXIX. There is a species called birds of Seleucis 0²th l

for whose arrival prayers are offered to Jupiter by the m qran θ’
inhabitants of Mount Cadmus when locusts destroy
their crops; it is not known where they come from,
nor where they go to when they depart‚ and they
are never seen except when their protectionis needed.
XL. Also the people of Egypt invoke their ibis to
guard against the arrival of snakes, and those of
Elis invoke the god Myiacores when a swarm of
flies brings plague, the flies dying as soon as a sacrifice
to this god has been performed.

XLI. But in the matter of the withdrawal of birds, The niyht- ,
it is stated that even night-owls go into retreat for Zth'an‘fzss‘ssss
a few days. It is said that this kind does not exist ⁰s species.
in the island of Crete and even that if one is im-
ported there it dies off. For this also is a remarkable
point of variety established by nature: to various
places she denies various species of animals as well
as of crops and shrubs. For those animals not to be
born there is in the ordinary course of things, but
their dying off when imported there is remarkable.

What is the factor adverse to the health of a single
genus that is involved, or what is the jealousy of
nature that is indicated? Or what frontiers are
prescribed for birds? Rhodes does not possess the
eagle; Italy north of the Po gives the name of
Corno to a lake near the Alps graced with a
wooded tract to which storks do not come; and
similarly jays and jackdaws—-a bird whose unique
fondness for stealing especially silver and gold is
remarkable—though swarming in enormous numbers
