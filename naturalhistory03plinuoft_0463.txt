BOOK XI. x, 21*24

their thighs, which are covered with scales so as to
serve this purpose, and with their beak load their
front feet, and when fully loaded return bulging
with their burden. Each is received by three or
four others who relieve him of his load: for indoors
also the duties are divided—some build, others
polish‚ others bring up material, others prepare
food from what is brought to them3 for they do not
seed separately‚ so that there shall be no inequality
of work or food or time. In building they begin
with the vaulting of the hive, and they bring down
as it were a web from the top of a loom, with two
balks round each square of work, so that some may
come in and others go out. The combs hang firmly
attached to the upper part and also a little to the
sides at the same time, but they do not reach to the
floor of the hive3 sometimes they are oblong and
sometimes round, according as the shape of the
hive requires, and occasionally also of both kinds,
when two swarms whose members are friendly
have different customs. They prop up combs that
are inclined to fall, the party-walls between the
pillars being arched from the ground level so as to
supply access for the purpose of repairing. The
first three rows or so are arranged empty, so that
there may not be any obvious temptation to a thief;
the last ones are filled fullest with honey;
consequently the combs are taken out from the back
of the hive. Carrier bees wait for favourable breezes.
If a storm arises, they steady themselves with the
weight of a little pebble held in their feet3 some
authorities say that it is placed on their shoulders.
