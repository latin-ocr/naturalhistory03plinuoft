eases—indeed it even supplies a prophylactic against
their attack3 we know that recently certain ladies
of the imperial house have made a practice of eating
venison every day in the morning and have been
free from severs throughout a long lifetime; though
it is thought that this only holds good if the stag has
been killed by a single wound.

The animal called the goat-stag, oceurring only
near the river Phasis,‘¹ is of the same appearance,
differ-ing only in having a beard, and a fleece on the
shoulders.

LI. Africa almost alone does not produce stags,
but Africa also has the chamaeleon, although India
produces it in greater numbers. Its shape and size
were those of a lizard, were not the legs straight
and longer. The flanks are joined on to the belly
as in fishes, and the spine projects in a similar manner.
It has a snout not unlike a pig’s‚ considering its
small size, a very long tail that tapers towards
the end and eurls in coils like a viper, and crooked
talons; it moves rather slowly like a tortoise and has
a rough body like a crocodile's‚ and eyes in a hollow
recess, close together and very large and of the same
colours as its body. It never shuts its eyes, and
looks round not by moving the pupil but by turning
the whole eye. It holds itself erect with its mouth
always wide open, and it is the only animal that does
not live on food or drink or anything else but the
nutriment that it derives from the air& with a gape
that is almost terrifying‚⁶ but otherwise it is harmless.
And it is more remarkable for the nature of its colour
ing, since it constantly changes the hue of its eyes
and tail and whole body and always makes it the
colour with which it is in closest contact, except
