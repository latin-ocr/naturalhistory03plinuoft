BOOK VIII. xxm. 62-xxv. 65

XXIII. The panther and the tiger almost alone of The panther.
beasts are distinguished by a variety of mai-kings,
whereas the rest have a single colour, each kind having
its own—black in the case of lions in Syria only.
Panthers have small spots like eyes on a light
ground. It is said that all four-footed animals are
wonderfully attracted by their smell, but frightened
by the savage appearance of their head3 for which
reason they catch them by hiding their head and
enticing them to approach by their other attractions.
Some authorities report that they have a mark on
the shoulder resembling a moon, expanding into a
circle and hollowed out in a similar mannerfl As it is,
people use the name ‘ spotted ladies '‚ and for the
males ‘pards ’‚ in the whole of this genus, which
occurs most frequently in Africa and Syria3 some
persons distinguish panthers from these by their
light colour only, nor have I hitherto discovered any
other difference.

XXIV. There was an old Resolution of the Senate Importacion
prohibiting the importation of African elephants into Ξζῑξξῇζῇε sm
Italy. Gnaeus Aufidius when Tribune of the Plebs ὓ show-⁹-
carried in the Assembly of the People a resolution
repealing this and allowing them to be imported for
shows in the Circus. But Scaurus in his aedileship⁶
first sent in procession 150 female leopards in one
flock, then Pompey the Great 410, and the late
lamented Augustus 420. XXV. Augustus also, in
the consulship ἀ of Marcus Tubero and Paullus
Fabius, at the dedication of the Theatre of
Marcellus, on May 7, was the first of all persons at
Rome who exhibited a tamed tiger in a cage, although
his late Majesty Claudius exhibited four at one
time.
