with, flying-fish fly over the sea with damp niem-
branes and bats among houses with dry ones3 the
wings of bats also have joints.

Shaggy hair grows out of a thick skin‚ whereas ar

women have finer hair3 horses have abundant hair
in the mane, lions on the shoulders, rabbits on the
cheeks inside and also under the feet‚hairin both places
being also recorded in the case of the hare by Trogus,
who infers from this example that among human
beings also the hairy ones are more licentious:
the hare is the shaggiest animal there is. Man
alone grows hair on the private parts, and if this does
Ποῖ occur is sterile, this applying to both sexes.
Human beings have some hair at birth and grow some
later3 the latter does not grow with men who have
been castrat-ed, though the hair they had at birth
does not fall off ; just as women also do not much
lose their hair, although there have been cases of
women afflicted with baldness, and also with down
on the face, when menstruation has ceased. With
some men the hair that comes after birth does not
grow readily. Four-footed animals shed their hair
and grow it again every year. With men the hair
of the head grows fastest and next that of the beard.
When the hair is cut it does Ποῖ grow again from the
incision, as plants and all other things do, but con-
tinues growing from the root. The hair grows longer
in some diseases, especially consumption‚ and in old
age too, and also on the bodies of the dead. Licen-
tious people loose the hair they had at birth earlier
and grow fresh hair more quickly. With four-footed
animals the hair gets thicker with age and the wool

thinner. Four-footed animals have shaggy backs
and bare bellies.
