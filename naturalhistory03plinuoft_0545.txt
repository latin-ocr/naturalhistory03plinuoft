such is their desire to achieve beauty that they colour
even their eyes 3 but really the lashes were bestowed
by nature for another purpose, as a sort of fence
to the sight and a barrier projecting against insects
meeting the eye, or other things accidentally falling
into them. It is said that sexual excess causes them
to drop off, not undeservedly. None of the other
species have them excepting those with hair on the
rest of the body as well, but quadrupeds have them
only on the upper lid, birds on the lower, as also do
creatures with a soft skjn, for instance snakes,
and oviparous quadrupeds, for instance lizards.

only viviparous creatures can wink. The heavier
birds close the eye with the lower lid, and also wink
