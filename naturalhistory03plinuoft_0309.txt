which it uses as weapons; they are cloven in two,
and are useful for grasping stones which when in

capacity for digesting the objects that it swallows
down indiscriminately is remarkable, but not less so

it has hidden its neck among bushes, in spite of the
great height of the rest ofits body. The eggs of the
ostrieh are extremely remark able for their size;

some people use them as vessels= and the feathers for
adorning the erests and helmets of warriors.

has a gleam of gold round its neck and all the rest of
it is purple, but the tail blue picked out with rose-
