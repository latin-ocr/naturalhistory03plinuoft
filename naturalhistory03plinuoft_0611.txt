its back3 it has large claws like a jay’s. Some
of the heavier birds, though none of those with
crooked talons, have spurs added on the legs. The
long-legged birds fly with their legs extended towards
their mil, but the short-legged ones draw them into
their middle. Those who say that there is no bird
without feet assert that black martins have specially
short feet, and also the Alpine swift, a bird that is
very rarely seen. Even snakes with the feet of geese
have been seen before now.

CVIII. The insects with hard eyes have the front Insecu

feet longer, so that they may occasionally rub their
eyes with their feet, as we observe in house-flies.
Insects with long hind feet leap, for instance locusts.
But all these have six feet. Somea spiders have
two very long feet in addition. Each foot has two
joints. We have saidb that some marine species
also have eight feet, oetopuses, cuttle-fish of both
varieties, and crabs, which move their fore-feet in the
opposite direction to the others and their hind-feet
in a circle or slantwise ; they are also the only animals
with feet of a rounded shape. All the other species
have two guiding feet, only crabs have four. Land
species that exceed this number of feet, as most
worms‚ have not less than twelve, and some as many
as a hundred. No kind has an odd number of feet.

In the species with solid feet the legs are of the
proper size at birth, afterwards more truly stretching
out than growing. Consequently in infancy they
scratch their ears with their hind feet, which when
older they are unable to do, because length of time
increases the size of only the surface of their bodles.
