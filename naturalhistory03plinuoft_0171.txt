BOOK VIII. mxxn. 220-223

neither wild nor tame but of a character inter-
mediate between each, for instance among winged
things swallows and bees‚‘¹ in the sea dolphins.
Many people have also placed in this class these
denizens of our homes the mice‚ a creature not to be
ignored among portents even in regard to public
affairs; they foretold the warb with the Marsians by
gnawing the silver shields at Lanuvium, and the death
of Genera] Carbo by gnawing at Chiusi ⁰ the puttees
that he wore inside his sandals. There are more
varieties of mice in the district of Cyrene, some with
broad and others with pointed heads, and others
like hedgehogs with prickly bristles. Theophrastus
states that on the island of Chiurad when they had
banished the inhabitants‘ they even gnawed iron,
and that they also do this by a sort of instinct in the
iron foundries in the country of the Chalybes! t
indeed, he says, in gold mines because of this their
bellies get cut away and their theft of gold is always
detected, ⁹ so fond are they of thieving. The Public
Records relate that during the siege ἢ of Casilinum by
Hannibal a mouse was sold for 200 francs, and that
the man who sold it died of hunger while the buyer
lived. The appearance of white mice constitutes a
joyful omen. For we have our Records full of
instances of the auspices being interruptedi by the
squeaking of shrews. Nigidius states that shrews
themselves also hibernate as do dormice‚ which
sumptuary legislation and Marcus Scaurus the
Head of the State during his consulship 7⁸· ruled out

⁹ Or perhaps ‘ their bellies are cut open and some stolen
gold is always found.’
