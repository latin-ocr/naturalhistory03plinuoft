rest keep their teeth permanently‚ but man, the lion,
the beasts of burdemdogs and ruminant animals shed
them ; with the lion and dog however this only applies
to those called dog-metha The right dog-tooth of a
wolf is held to be valuable as an amuletss’ No
animal sheds its maxillary teeth, the ones next to
the dog-teeth. In man those called wisdom-teeth
grow latest, at about the age of twenty, and in many
cases even at eighty, with females as well, but only in
the case of persons who did not grow them in youth.
It is certain that in old age they fall out and then
grow again. Mucianus has stated that he saw
a Samothracian named Zocles who grew a new
set of teeth when 140 years old. For the rest,
males have more teeth than females in the case of
man, QX, goat and pig.‘² Timarchus son of Nicocles
at Paphos had two rows of maxilla1·ies; his brother
did not shed his front teeth‚ and consequently wore
them down. There is a case of a person even growing
a tooth in the palate. Any of the dog teeth lost
by some accident never grow again. With all other
species the teeth get red in old age, but in the horse
alone they become whiter.

and-a-half years old it loses two front ones in each
jaw, and in the following year the same number of
the teeth next these, when they are replaced by
those called grinders3 at the beginning of its fifth
year it looses two teeth‚ which grow again in its
sixth year; in its seventh year it has all of its second
teeth and also its permanent ones. A horse

previously gelt does not shed its teeth.‘¹ The ass
