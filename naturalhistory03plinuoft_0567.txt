LXXII. Below the heart are situated the lungs, rhemnon
the breathing apparatus, drawing in and sending
back the breath‚ and consequently spongy in sub—
stance and perforated with empty tubes. As has
been said, few aquatic species possess lungs, and in
the oviparous species they are small and contain
froth, not blood3 consequently these species do not
experience thirst. The same cause makes it possible
for frogs and seals to stay long under water. Also
the lungs of the tortoise, although very large and
spreading under the whole of its shell‚are nevertheless
devoid of blood. The speed of a creature’s movement
varies inversely with the size of its lungs. The
chamaeleon's lungs are extremely large in proportion

Hannibal, found the liver missing among 1116 organs,
but 011 1116 following day a double liver was dis-
covered. The liver was also missing with Gaius
Marius when he offered sacrifice ⁰ at Utica, and also
with the Emperor Gaius [ἶ 011 January 1 31 1116 00111-

and with his successor Claudius in the month in which
he was poisoned.⁹ When the late lamented Augustus
was sacrificing 31 Spoleto on the first day he was in
power the livers of six victims were found with the
bottom of their tissue folded back inward‚ and this
was interpreted to mean that he would double his
power within a year. It is also of gloomy omen
when the head of the liver is accidentally cut—-
except at a period of trouble and alarm‚ when it
