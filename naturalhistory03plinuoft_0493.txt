are smallcr than the others—kill one kind of spider
called phalangium and carry them to their nests and
then smear them over, and from these by incubating
produce their own species. Moreover they all feed
on flesh, contrary to bees which never touch a body.

But wasps hunt larger flies and after cutting off

their heads carry away the rest of the body.

The forest variety of hornets live in hollow trees,
hibernating in winter like the rest of insects3 they
do not live beyond the age of two. Their sting is
rarely not followed by sever. Some authorities state
that twenty-seven α hornet—stings will kil] a human
being. Another kind that seems less fierce has two
classes—workers, smaller in size‚ which die in winter,
aud mothers‚ which last two years: these are not
fierce at all. They make nests in spring, usually with
four entrances‚ in which to breed the workers. When
these have been reared, they then make other lai-ger
nests, in which they may now produce those who are
to be mothers. Thcn the workers begin to function‚
and feed the mothers. The mothers are of a wider
shape‚ and it is doubtful whether they possess stings,
because they do not come out. These also have
their drones. Some people hold the view that all
these insccts lose their stings towards winter.
Neither the hornet nor the wasp kind have kings,
nor do they suarm, but their numbers are continually
renewed by offspring.

XXV. Among these is a fourth genus, the silk-

Hor-new.

The silk-
moth: its

moth, which occurs in Assyria; it is larger than the emon d ,os

kinds mentioned above. Silk-moths make their nests
of mud like a sort of salt3 they are attached to a
stone, and are so hard that they can scarcely be
pierced with javelins. In these nests they make
