of feeding male chickens also with foodstuffs soaked
in milk, a method that makes them esteemed as
much more acceptable. As for hens, they are not
all chosen for fattening, and not unless they have
fat skin on the neck. Subsequently came elaborate
methods of diessing fowls, so as to display the
haunches‚ so as to split them along the back, so as
to make them fill the dishes by spreading them out
from one foot. Even the Parthians bestowed their
fashions on our cooks. And neverthcless with all
this showing off, no entire dish finds favour, only the
haunch or in other cases the breast being esteemed.

LXXII. Aviaries with cages containing all kinds
of birds were first set up by Marcus Laenius Strabo
of the Order of Knighthood at Brindisi. From him
began our practice of imprisoning within bars living
creatures to which Nature had assigned the open sky.
Nevertheless the most remarkable instance in this
record is the dish belonging to the tragic actor
Clodius Aesop, rated at the value of 100,000 sesterces,
in which he served birds that sang some particular
song or talked with human speech, which he acquired
at the price of 6000 sesterces apiece‚ led by no
other attraction except the desire to indulge in a
sort of cannibalism in eating these birds, and not even
showing any respect for that lavish fortune of his,
even though won by his voice—in fact a worthy father
of a son whom we have spoken Ofa as swallowing
pearls‚ though not so much so as to make me wish to
give a true decision in the competition in baseness
between the two, unless in so far as it is a smaller
-thing to have dined on the most bounteous resources
of Nature than on the tongues of men.
