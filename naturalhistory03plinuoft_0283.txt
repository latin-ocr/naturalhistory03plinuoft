list of 3111111313 35 1116 ‘ cloud ' or ⁶ sog-,³ which is the
name the divers give to this plague. Divers have
fierce fights with the dog-fish3 these attack their loins
and heels and all the white parts of the body. The
one safety lies in going for thern and frightening
them by taking the offcnsive3 for a dog-fish is as
much afraid os a man as a man is of it, and so they
are on equal 1611113 111 deep water. When they come
to 1116 31111366, 111611 1116 111311 13 111 critical danger, as
the policy of taking the offensive is not available
while he is trying to get out of the water, and his
only safcty is in his eorm-ades. These haul on the
rope tied to his shoulders‚ · this, as 116 carries on the
duel, he shakes with his left hand to give a signal
of danger, while his right hand grisps his dagger
and is occupied 1n fighting. Most of the time they
haul gently, but when heo gets 11631 1116 boat, unless
with 3 quick heave they suddenly 31131611 him out
of the water, they have to look on 1111116 116 15 made
away with. And often when divers have already
begun to be hauled up they are snatched out of
their comrades' hands, unless they have themselves
supplemented the aid of those hauling by curling up
into a ball. Others of the crew of course thrust
out harpoons, but the vast beast is crafty enough to
go under the 165361 and so carry on the battle in
safety. Consequently divers devote their whole atten-
tion to keeping 3 1131611 against this disaster ς the most
reliable token of safety 13 to 11316 36611 301116 1131-11311,
