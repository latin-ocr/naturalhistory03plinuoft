in the rocky sea of Asia3 this fish is frequent there,
and is quickly caught, in one variety. A fisherman
sails out a certain distance in a small boat, wearing
clothes that match the boat in colour‚ and at the

mark it, as for several days only this one ventures
to come close. At last it finds others as well, and
gradually enlarging its company finally brings shoals

a hook fixed in the bait a little beyond his fingers,
and catches or rather rushes them one by one,
snatching them with a short jerk away from the
shadow of the boat so that the others may not

very well known, and caught it, with malicious

market by the partner who was being victimized‚
and that proceedings for damage were instituted and
