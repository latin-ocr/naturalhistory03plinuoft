Spain called rabbits also belong to the genus hare3
their fertility is beyond counting, and they bring
famine to the Balearic Islands by ravaging the crops.
Their young cut out from the mother before birth or
taken from the teat are considered a very great
delicacy, served without being gutted; the name for
them is laur-ex. It is an established fact that the
peoples of the Balearics petitioned the late lamented
Augustus for military assistance against the spread
of these animals. The ferret is extremely popular
for rabbit—hunting3 they throw ferrets into the
burrows with a number of exits that the rabbits
tunnel in the ground (this is the derivation of their
name ‘ cony ’ ⁰) and so catch the rabbits when they
are driven out to the surface. Archelaus states that
a hare is as many years old as it has folds in the bowel:
these are certainly found to vary in number. The
same authority says that the hare is a hermaphrodite
and reproduces equally well without a male. Nature
has shown her benevolence in making harmless and
edible breeds of animals prolific. The hare which is
born to be all creatures' prey is the only animal
beside the shaggy-footed rabbit that practises super-
fetation, rearing one leveret while at the same time
carrying in the womb another clothed with hair and
another bald and another still an embryo. Also the
experiment has been made of using the fur of the
hare for making clothes, although it is not so soft to
the touch as it is when on the animal’s skin, and the
garments soon come to pieces because of the short-
ness of the hair.⁶
