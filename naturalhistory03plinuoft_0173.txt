from banquets just as they did shell-fish or birds
imported from other parts of the world. The shrew-
mouse itself also is a half-wild animal, and keeping it
alive in jars was originated by the same person as
started keeping wild pigs.‘¹ In this connexion it has
been noticed that shrew-mice do not associate unless
they are natives of the same forest, and if foreigners
separated by a river or mountain are introduced they
die fighting one another. They seed their parents
when exhausted by old age with remarkable affection.
Their old age comes to its end during the winter
repose ⁶-for these creatures also hibernate, and
renew their youth at the coming of summer. Dormice
hibernate similarly.

LXXXIII. In this connexion it is surprising that
Nature has not only assigned different animals to
different countries‚ but has also denied certain
animals to some places in the same region. In the
Mesian forest ⁶ in Italy dormice of which we are now
speaking are only found in one part. In Lycia the
gazelles do not cross the mountains near the Sexi,
nor the wild asses the boundary dividing Cappadocia
from Cilicia. The stags on the Hellespont do not
migrate into unfamiliar districts, and those in the
neighbourhood of Arginusa do not go beyond Mount
Elaphus, even those on the mountain having cleft
earsf‘ In the island of Pordoselene e weasels do not
cross a road. Similarly in Boeotia moles that under·
mine the whole of the fields in Orchomenus near by,
when imported into Lebadea are shy of the very soil.
We have seen counterpanes for beds made out of
their skins: so power-less is even superstition to
protect the miraculous against luxury. In Ithaca
imported hares die on the very edge of the shore, as
