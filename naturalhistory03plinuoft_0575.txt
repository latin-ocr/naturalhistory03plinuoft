food passes‚ and in the other species the entrails‚⁰ osdwe stum.
from which the roomier intestines pass to the belly,
and in the case of man in extremely winding coils.
On this account species in which the distance from
the belly is longer are greedier for food; moreover
those with a very fat abdomen are less elever.
Birds also in some cases have two receptacles, one
down which food just eaten passes to the throat‚ the
other into which they pass the food from the throat
when digested-e.g. bens, ring-doves, pigeons and
partridges. Almost all the other species in most
cases have not got this, but make use of a more
widely opened gullet‚ for instance jays, ravens
and crows. Some species treat the food in neither
manner, but have the abdomen very near3 these are
species that have specially long and narrow necks‚
for instance the sultana-hen. The abdomen of
whole—hoofed animals is rough and hard. In that of
some land animals the roughness is denticulated,
and in that of others it has a latticed bite. Species
that are without teeth in both jaws and that do not
ruminate digest their food here and pass it down
from here into the belly. This in all species is
attached at its middle to the navel; in man at its
lower part it resembles the belly of a pig; the
Greeks call it the colon3 it is the seat of a great
cause of pain. In dogs it is extremely narrow, aud
for this reason they can only relieve it with a violent
effort and not without severe pain. The most
ravenous animals are those in whom the food passes
