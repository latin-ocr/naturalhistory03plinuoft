rising of the great stars, and also at the solstice‚
when thyme and grape-vines begin to flower, the
outstanding material for the cells. It is however
necessary to practice economy in taking away the
combs‚ as lack of food causes the bees to despair
and die or fly away, and on the other hand a large
supply brings sloth‚ and then the bees seed on the
honey and not on bee-bread ; consequently the more
careful beekeepers leave a fifteenth part of this vintage
to the bees. The day fixed for beginning by a sort of
law of nature, if only men would know or keep it, is
the thirtieth after the leading out of the swarm; and
this vintage usually falls within the month of May.

The second kind of honey is summer honey, the
Greek name for which consequently is ‘ ripe honey‚’
because it is produced in the most favourable season,
when the dogstar is shining in its full splendour‚
about thirty days after midsummer. In respect
of this, immense subtlety on the part of nature
has been displayed to mortals, did not man’s dis-
honesty spoil everything with its banefulness. For
after the rising of each star, but particularly the
principa] stars, or of a rainbow, if rain does not
follow but the dew is warmed by the rays of the sun,
not honey but drugs are produced, heavenly gifts
for the eyes, for ulcers and for the interna] organs.
And if this substance is kept when the dogstar is
rising, and if, as often happens, the rise of Venus or
Jupiter or Mercury falls on the same day, its sweet-
ness and potency for recalling mortals' ills from
death is equal to that of the nectar of the gods.

moon, and of thicker substance in fine weather. In
