BOOK VIII. xxv. 66—xxvl. 68

Hyrcania and India produce the tiger, an animal Τίφα
of terrific speed,which is most noticeable when the mmmm·
whole of its litter, which is always numerous, is
being captured. The litter is taken by a man lying

second hump beneath the chest on which they can
rest their weight; but both kinds resemble oxen
in having no teeth in the upper jaw. All however
perform the services of beasts of burden‚ and also of
cavalry in battle33 their speed is below that of
horses. But the two kinds differ in dimensions, as

its customary march, nor carry more than the regula-
tion load. They possess an innate hatred for horses.
They can endure thir-st for as much as four days, and
when they have an opportunity they replenish them-
selves both for the past interval and for the future,
stirring up the water by trampling with their fore
feet before they drink-otherwise they do not enjoy
the draught. They live for fifty years, some even
