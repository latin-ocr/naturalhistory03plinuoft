coloured feathers and the throat picked out with
tufts, and a feathered crest adorning its head. The
first and the most detailed Roman account of it was
given by Manilius, the eminent senator famed for
his extreme and varied learning acquired without a
teacher: he stated that nobody has ever existed
that has seen one feedhxg, that in Arabia it is
sacred to the Suu-god, that it lives 540 years, that
when it is growing old it constructs a nest with
sprigs of wild cinnamon and frankincense‚ fills it
with scents and lies on it till it dies3 that subse-
quently from its bones and marrow is born first a
sort of maggot‚ and this grows into a chicken‚ and that
this begins by paying due funeral rites to the former
bird and carrying the whole nest down to the City
of the Sun near Panchaia and depositing it upon an
altar there. Manilius also states that the period of
the Great Year coincides with the life of this bird,
and that the same indications of the seasons and stars
return again, and that this begins about noon on the
day on which the sun enters the sign of the Ram,
and that the year of this period had been 215, as
reported by him, in the consulship ‘² of Publius
Licinius and Gnaeus Cornelius. Cornelius Valerianus
reports that a phoenix flew down into Egypt in the
consulship ¹³ of Quintus Plautius and Sextus Papinius ;
it was even brought to Rome in the Censorship of
the Emperor Claudius, A.U.C. 800 Β and displayed in
the Comitium2 a fact attested by the Recmds,
although nobody would doubt that this phoenix was
a fabrication.
