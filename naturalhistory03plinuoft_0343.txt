bird with food makes the liver grow to a great
size, and also when it has been removed it is made
larger by being soaked in milk sweetened with
honey. Not without reason is it a matter of enquiry
who was the discoverer of so great a boon—was it
Scipio Metellus the consular, or his contemporary
Marcus Seius, Knight ofRome ? But it is an accepted
fact that Messalinus Cotta, son of the orator Messala,
invented the recipe for taking from geese the soles
of the feet and grilling them and pickling them
in dishes with the combs of domestic cocks; for I
will award the palm scrupulously to each man’s
culinary achievement. A remarkable feat in the
case of this bird is its coming on foot all the way to
Rome from the Morini in Gaul: the geese that get
tired are advanced to the front rank, and so all the
rest drive them on by instinctively pressing forward
in their rear.

White geese yield a second profit 111 their feathers. 000
In some places they are plucked twice a year, and
clothe themselves again with a feather coat. The ’
plumage closest to the body is softer, and that
from Germany is most esteemed. The geese there

for this bird is Gans3 the price of their feathers is five-
pence per pound. And owing to this officers in
command of auxiliary troops frequently get into
trouble for having sent whole cohorts away from
outpost sentry duty to capture these fowls; and
luxury has advanced to such a pitch that now not

even the male neck can endure to be without goose-

feather bedding.
