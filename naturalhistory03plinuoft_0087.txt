comes ashore to reconnoitre places where rushes
have recently been cut, and where it sees an extremely
sharp stalk it squeezes its body down on to it and
makes a wound in a certain vein in its leg, and by thus
letting blood unburdens its body, which would
otherwise be liable to disease‚ and plasters up the
wound again with mud.

XLI, A somewhat similar display has also been
made in the same country of Egypt by the bird called
the ibis, which makes use of the curve of its beak to
purge itself through the part by which it is most
conducive to health for the heavy residue of foodstuffs
to be excreted. Nor is the ibis alone, but many
animals have made discoveries destined to be useful
for man as well. The value of the herb dittany for
extracting arrows was shown by stags when wounded
by that weapon and ejecting it by grazing on that
he1·b; likewise stags when bitten by the phalangium,
a kind os spider‚ or any similar animal cure themselves
by eating crabs. There is also a herb that is par-
ticularly good for snake-bites, with which lizards
heal themselves whenever they fight a battle with
snakes and are wounded. Celandine was shown
to be very healthy for the sight by swallows using it
as a medicine for their chicks' sore eyes. The
tortoise eats cunila ⁰, called ox—grass, to restore its
strength against the effect of snake-bites ; the weasel
cures itself with rue when it has had a fight with
miee in hunting them. The stork drugs itself with
marjoram in sickness‚ and goats use ivy and a
diet consisting mostly of crabs thrown up from the
sea. When a snake's body gets covered with a skin
owing to its winter inaetivity it sloughs this hindrance
to its movement by means of fennel-sap and comes
