the honey has begun to ripen, the bees drive the
drones away, and falling on them many to one kill
them. Moreover this class of bee is only seen in
spring. If a drone is stripped of its wings and after·
wards thrown back into the hive it itself strips
the wings off the others. XII. They build large may-bees*
and splendid separate palaces for those who are to be palam·
their rulers, in the bottom of the hive3 these project

None of these tasks are done at a fixed time, but they
snatch their duties on fine days. They fill their
cells with honey on one or at most two days.
Honey comes out of the air, and is chiefly formed They collect

or the moisture of the air purging itself. And
