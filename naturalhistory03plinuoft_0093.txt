by snakes. North of the Ethiopic tribe of the
Bitch—milkers there is a wide belt of desert where
a tribe was wiped out by seorpions and poisonous
spiders‚ and Theophrastus states that the Rhoetienses
were driven away by a kind of centipede.

But let us return to the remaining kinds of wild
animals.

XLIV. The hyena is popularly believed to be
bi-sexual and to become male and female in alternate
years, the female bearing offspring without a male;
but this is denied by Aristotle. Its neck stretches
right along the backbone like a mane, and cannot
bend without the whole body turning round. A
number of other remarkable facts about it are
reported, but the most remarkable are that among
the shepherds’ homesteads it simulates human
speech, and picks up the name of one of them
so as to call him to come out of doors and tear him
in pieces‚ and also that it imitates a person being
sick, to attract the dogs so that it may attack them;
that this animal alone digs up graves in search of
corpses; that a female is seldom caught3 that its
eyes have a thousand variations and alterations of
colour3 moreover that when its shadow falls on
dogs they are struck dumb3 and that it has certain
magio arts by which it causes every animal at which
it gazes three times to stand rooted to the spot.
XLV. When crossed with this race of animals the
Ethiopian lioness gives birth to the corocottae that
mimics the voices of men and cattle in a similar way.
It has an unbroken ridge of bone in each jaw, forming
a continuous tooth without any gum, which to
prevent its being blunted by contact with the
opposite jaw is shut up in a sort osease. J uba states
