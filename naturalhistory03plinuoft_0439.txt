each species in their places. There are quarrels
between swans and eagles3 between the raven and
the golden oriolea when searching for one another's
eggs by night; similarly between the raven and the
kite when the former snatches the latter’s food
before he can get it3 between crows and owls, the
eagle and the gold-crest—if we can believe it, as the
eagle is called the king of birds; between owls and
the other smaller birds3 again birds with land
animals—the weasel and the crOW, the turtle-dove
and the pyrallis, ichneumon-flies and spiders; the
water—birds brenthos and gull and goshawk and
buzzard3 shrewmice and herons lying in wait
for each other’s young; that very tiny bird the
titmouse b with the ass‚ which by rubbing itself
against thorns for the sake of scratching dislodges
the nests of the titmouse‚ which is so seared that
when it merely hears the sound of an ass braying
it throws its eggs out of the nest, and the chicks
themselves in fear fall out, and consequently the
bird flies at the ass and hollows out its sores
with its beak3 foxes and kites3 snakes and weasels
and pigs. There is a small bird called the aesalon
that breaks a raven’s eggs, whose chicks are preyed
upon by foxes, and it retaliates by peeking the fox-
cubs and the vixen herself3 when the ravens see
this they come to their aid against the aesalon as
against a common foe. Also the gold-flnch lives
in thorn-bushes and consequently it also hates asses
