see one of their number hooked they cut the line
with the saw—like prickles that they have on their

as to enable it to be severed. With the sargus kind
however the captive itself rubs the line against the
rocks.

LXXXVI. Besides these cases I observe that
authors renowned for their wisdom express surprise
at there being a star in the sea: that is the shape
of the fish,s¹ which has rather little flesh inside it but
a rather hard rind outside. They say that this fish
contains such fiery heat that it scorches all the things
it touches in the sea, and digests all food immedi-

this has been ascertaffled, and I should consider a
fact that there is daily opportunity of experiencing
to be much more worth recording.

LXXXVII. The class shellfish includes the piddock,
named finger—mussel from its resemblance to a
human finger—nail. Itis the nature of these fish to
shine in darkness with a bright light when other
light is removed, and in proportior] to their amount
of moisture to glitter both in the mouth of persons
masticating them and in their hands, and even on the
floor and on their clothes when drops fall from them,
