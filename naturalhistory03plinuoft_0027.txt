BOOK VIII. v. 11-13

Elephants always travel in a her3d the oldest lesi για-ιι
leads the column and the next oldest brings up the '‘⁷‘'ss
rear. XVhen going to fo1d a riv-ei they put the “and aeffcftsst
smallest in front, so that the bottom may not be
worn away by the tread of the larger ones, thus

that two elephants employed for military purposes
by King Antiochus were known to the public even

an elephant's greatest delight, and with every other
mark of leadership. The one disgraced preferred
death by starvation to humiliation3 for the elephant
