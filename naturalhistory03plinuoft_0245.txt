soft mud. In winter they haunt sunny shores, but
in summer they retire into the dim depths of the sea.
All creatures of this class suffer in winter, but get
fat in autumn and spring, and more so at full moon,
because the moon mellows them with its warm glow

yLI.g The kinds of crab are the carabus,⁶ the crayfish,
the spider-crab, the hermit-crab, the Heraclean crab,
the lion-crab and other inferior species. The carabus
differs from the other crabs by its tail; in Phoenicia
it is called the horse-crab, being so swift that it is im-
possible to overtake it. Crabs are long-lived. They
have eight feet, all eurved crooked3 the front foot
is double in the female and single in the male. They
also have two claws with denticulated nippers; the
upper half of the forepart of these moves and the
lower half is fixed. The right claw is the larger in
every specimen. Sometimes crabs all collect together
in a flock. They cannot make the mouth of the
Black Sea against the current, and consequently
when they are going out of it they travel round in
a circle and appear to be following a beaten track.
The one called the pea-crab is the smallest of the
whole tribe, and consequently very liable to injury.
It has the cunning to stow itself in empty bivalve
shells and to shift into roomier ones as it grows
bigger. When alarmed crabs can retreat back-
wards with equal speed. They fight duels with one
another like rams, charging with horns opposed.
They afford a remedy against snake-bite. It is
related that when the sun is passing through the
sign of Cancer the bodies of crabs also when they
expire are transformed into scorpions during the
drought.
