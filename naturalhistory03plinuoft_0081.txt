XXXVI. That animal, which is also a native of {stemma

Egypt, is specially known because of this exploit.
The asp repeatedly plunges into mud and dries itself
in the sun, and then when it has equipped itself with
a cuirass of several coatings by the same method‚ it
proceeds to the encounter. In this it raises its tail
and renders the blows it receives ineffectual by
turning away from them, till after watching for its
opportunity, with head held sideways it attacks its
adversary’s throat. And not content with this
victim it vanquishes another animal no less ferocious,
the crocodile.

XXXVII. This belongs to the Nile; it is a curse The η
on four legs, and equally pernicious on land and in ⁰'⁰⁶⁰d²l⁶·
the river. It is the only land animal not furnished
with a tongue and the only one that bites by press-
ing down the mobile upper jaw, and it is also
formidable because of its row of teeth set close
together like a comb. In size it usually exceeds
18 ells. It lays as many eggs as a goose, and by a
kind of prophetie instinct incubates them always
outside the line to which the Nile in that year is
going to rise at full flood. Nor does any other animal
grow to greater dimensions from a smaller original
size3 however, it is armed with talons as well,
and its hide is invincible against all blows. It passes
its days on land and its nights in the water, in both
cases for reasons of warmth. This creature when
sated with a meal of fish and sunk in sleep on the
shore with its mouth always full of food, is tempted
by a small bird (called there the trochilus? but in
Italy the king-bird) to open its mouth wide to enable
the bird to feed3 and first it hops in and cleans out
the mouth, and then the teeth and inner throat also,
