if its extremely slender membrane is merely cut into,
death follows immediately. Species with long legs
also have long necks; as also have aquatic species
even though they have short legs, and similarly
if they have hooked claws.

LXVIII. Man and swine alone suffer from swollen
throat, usually due to bad drinking water. The top
part of the gullet is called the pharynx and the bottom
part the stomach. This name denotes the cavity
attached to the spine below the fleshy part of the
windpipe, bulging out lengthwise and breadthwise
like a flagon. Species without a pharynx‚ for
instance fishes, have no stomach either, and no neck
nor throat, and the mouth is joined to the abdomen.
The sea tortoise has not got a tongue α or teeth, but
breaks up all its food with the point of its snout.
Next comes the windpipe and the stomach, denti-
culated with ridges of thick skin like bramble-thorns
for the purpose of grinding up the food, the interstices
growing smaller in proportion as they are nearer to
the abdomen: at the bottom it is as rough as a
carpenter's rasp.

LXIX. The heart with the other animals is in the

middle of the chest‚ but in man alone it is below the ²

left breast, with its conical end projecting forward.
In fishes only it points towards the mouth. It is
stated that at birth the heart is the first organ
formed in the womb, and next the brain, just as the
eyes develop latest, but that the eyes are the first
to die and the heart the last. The heart is the
warmest part. It has a definite beat and 3 motion
of its own as if it were a second animal inside the
animal3 it is wrapped with a very soft and firm
covering of membrane, and protected by the wall
