With all the other species the tip of the tongue Tam·
is the seat of taste, but with man this is also situated
in the palate.

species possesses the lesser tongue α below the
uvula. Its functions are twofold, placed as it is
between two tubes. Of these the inner one called
the windpipe stretches to the lungs and the heart3
this the lesser tongue closes while food is being
caten, as breath and voice passes along it, lest if
drink or food should pass into the wrong channel,
it might cause pain. The other, the outer tube, is
of course called the gullet, down which food and
drink fall; this leads to the stomach, and the
stomach to the abdomen. This passage the lesser

possessing a nape it is composed of a number of
bones articulated in rings with jointed vertebrae,

vertebrae. It is inferred that the spinal cord is of
the same substance as the hrain for the reason that,
