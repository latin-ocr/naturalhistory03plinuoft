sides; but there are some that fly with their wings
for the greater part fohied, and after giving one
stroke, or others also a repeated stroke, are borne by
the air: by as it were squeezing it tight between
their wings, they shoot upward or horizontally or
downward. Some you would think to be flung for—
ward, or again in some cases to fall from a height and
in other cases to leap upward. Only ducks and birds
of the same kind soar up straight away, and move
skyward from the start, and this even from water3
and consequently they alone when they have fallen
into the pits that we use for trapping wild animals
get out again. vultures and the heavier birds in
general cannot fly upward except after a run forward
or when launching from a higher eminence3 they
steer with their tail. Some birds turn their gaze
round, others bend their necks; and some eat things
they have snatched with their feet. Many do not
fly without a cry, others on the contrary are always
silent when in fiight. They move upward, downward,
slanting, sideways, straight forward, and some even
with the head bent baekward3 consequently if
several kinds are seen at the same time, they might
be thought not to be travelling in the same
element.

LV. The greatest flyers are the species resembling Fliqmos
swallows called apodesa (because they lack the use of '‘¹¹¹²'s'5'
feet) and by others ‘ cypseli.’ They build their
nests on crags. These are the birds seen all over
the sea, and ships never go away from land on so
long or so unbroken a course that they do not have
apodes flying round them. All the other kinds alight
and perch, but these never rest except on the nest:
they either hover or lie on a surface.
