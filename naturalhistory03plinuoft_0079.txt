XXXV. As concerning sei-pents‚ it is generally The snake.
stated that most of them have the colour of the earth
that they usually lurk in ; that there are innumerable
kinds of the1n; that horned snakes have little horus,
often a cluster of four, projecting from the body, by
inoving which so as to hide the rest of the body they
lure birds to them 3 that the amphisbaena α has a twin
head, that is one at the tail-end as well, as though
it were not enough for poison to be poured out osone
mouth3 that some have scales, others coloured
markings, and all a deadly venom3 that the javelin-
snake hurls itself from the branc-hes of trees, and
that serpents are not only formidable to the feet but
fly like a missile from a catapult3 that when asps’
neeks swell up there is no remedy for their sting
except the immediate amputation of the parts
stung. Although so pestilential, this animal has one
emotion or rather affection: they usually roam in
couples, male and female, and only live with their
consort. Accordingly when either of the pair has
been destroyed the other is incredibly anxious for
revenge: it pursues the murderer and by means
of some mark of recognition attacks him and him
only in however large a throng of people‚ bursting
through all obstacles and traversing all distances‚ and
it is only debarred by rivers or by very rapid ssight.

It is impossible to declare whether Nature has
engendered evils or remedies more bountifully. In
the first place she has bestowed on this accursed
creature dim eyes, and those not in the forehead for
it to look straight in front of it, but in the temples
-— and consequently it is more quickly excited by
hearing than by sight3 and in the next place she has
given it war to the death with the ichneumonb.
