the osprey, which has very keen eye-sight, and
which hovers at a great height and when it sees 3 fish
in the sea drops on it with a swoop and cleaving the
water with its breast catches it. The species that
we made the third hunts round marshes for water-
birds, which at once dive, till they become drowsy
and exhausted, when it catches them. The duel is
worth watching, the bird making for refuge on the
shore, especially if there is a dense med-bed, and the
eagle driving it away from the shore with a blow of
its wing; and when it is hunting its quarry in a lake,
soaring and showing its shadow to the bird swimming
under water away from the shore, so that the bird
turns back again and comes to the surface at a place
where it thinks it is least expected. This is the
reason why birds swim in flocks‚ because several are
not attacked at the same time, since they blind the
enemy by splashing him with their wings. Often
even the eagles themselves cannot carry the weight of
their catch and are drowned with it. The sea-eagle
only compels its still unfledged chicks by beating
them to gaze full at the rays of the sun, and if it
notices one blinking and with its eyes water-ing flings
it out of the nest as 3 bastard and not true to stock,
whereas one whose gaze stands firm against the light
it rears. Sea-eagles have no breed of their own but
are born from cross—breeding with other eagles; but
the offspring of a pair of sea-eagles belongs to the
osprey genus, from which spring the smaller vultures,
and from these the great vultures which do not breed
at all. Some people add a species of eagle which
they call the bearded eagle‚‘¹ but which the Tuscans
eall an ossifrage.
