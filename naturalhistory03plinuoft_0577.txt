directly from the abdomen right down the gut3 this
is the case with lynxes, and among birds cormorants.
The elephant has four a abdomens, but its other parts
resemble those of pigs3 its lungs are four times as
large as those of an ox. Birds have a fleshy and
hard abdomen. In the abdomen of swallow chicks
there are found white or red coloured pebbles‚
called swallow-stones; there are accounts of these
in the treatises on magio. Also in the second
abdomen of heifers is found a round ball b of blackish
tufa that weighs nothing3 this is thought to be a
sovereign remedy for difficulty in child-birth if it has
never been allowed to touch the ground.

LXXX. The abdomen and bowels except in the
oviparous species are wrapped in a fat thin caul.
To this is attached the spleen on the left side opposite
the liver, with which it occasionally changes place,
but this constitutes a portent. Some think that
oviparous species contain a spleen, and also snakes
a rather small one3 this undoubtedly appears to be
so in the case of the tortoise‚ the crocodile, lizards
and frogs. It is certain that the goat’s-head bird
has not got a spleen, nor have the bloodless species.
Sometimes it causes a peculial· impediment in run-
ning, owing to which runners who have trouble have
an operation to reduce it. Also cases are reported
of animals living after it has been removed by an in-
cision. There are some who think that this operation
deprives a man of the power of laughing, and that
inability to control one's laughter is caused by
enlargement of the spleen. It is said that in a
district in Asia called Scepsis the cattle have ex-
tremely small spleens, and that remedies for the
spleen have been imported from there.
