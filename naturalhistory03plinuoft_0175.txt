do rabbits in Iviza, although Spain and the Balearic
Islands close by are teeming with them. At Cyrene
the frogs were silent, and though croaking frogs have
been imported from the mainland the silent breed
goes on. Frogs are also silent in the island of
Seriphus, but the same frogs croak when removed
to some other place, which is also said to happen in
the Siccanean Lake in Thessaly. The bite of the
shrew-mouse in Italy is venomous, but the venornous
species is not found in the district beyond the
Apennines. Also wherever it occurs it dies if it
crosses the track of a wheel. There are no wolves on
Mount Olympus in Macedon, nor in the island of
Crete. In fact in Crete there are no wolves or bears
either, and no noxious animal at all except a poisonous
spider: we shall speak of this species in its place,“
under the head of spiders. It is more remarkable
that in the same island there are no stags except in
the district of Cydonea, and the same is the case with
wild boars and francolins and hedgehogs, while in
Africa there are neither wild boars nor stags nor wild
goats nor bears.

they are maleficent to other people of whatever racc,
