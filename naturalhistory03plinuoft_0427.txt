is the mouse-one hesitates to state its fertssity, ev en
though on the authority of Aristotle and the troops
of Alexander the Great. It is stated that with it
impregnation takes place by licking and not by
coupling. There is a record of 120 being born from
a single mother, and in Persia of mice already preg-

believed that they are made pregnant by tasting salt.
Accordingly it ceases to be surprising how so large
an army of field-Inice ravages the crops3 and in the
case of field-mice it is also hitherto unknown exactly
how this vast multitude is suddenly destroyed:
for they are never found dead, and nobody exists
who ever dug up a mouse in a field in winter. Vast
numbers thus appear in the Troad, and they have
by now banished the inhabitants from that country.
They appear during droughts. It is also related
that when a mouse is going to die a worm grows in
its head. The mice in Egypt have hard hair like
hedgehogs‚ and also they walk on two feet, as also
do the Alpine mice.—--When animals of a different

kind pair, the union is only fertile when the two species ι,

have the same period of gestation.‘2—-There is a
popular belief that of the oviparous quadrupeds the
lizard bears through the mouth, but this is denied
by Aristotle. Lizards do not hatch their eggs, but

memory, · and consequently the young ones break the

shell without assistance.
