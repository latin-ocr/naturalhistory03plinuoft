make use of these dresses‚ because of their lightness
in summer: so far have our habits departed from
wearing a leather cuirass that even a robe is con-
sidered a burden! All the same we so far leave the
Assyrian silk-moth to women.

XXVIII. To these may be not ineptly joined the
nature of spiders, which deserves even exceptional
admiration. There are several kinds of spiders‚
but they need not be described, as they are so well
known. The name of phalangium is given to a
kind of spider that has a harmful bite and a small
body of variegated colour and pointed shape‚ and
advances by leaps and bounds. A second species
of spider is black, with very long fore legs. All
spiders have legs with two joints.‹1 Of the wolf-
spiders the smallest do not weave a web, but the
larger ones live in the ground and spin tiny ante-
rooms in front of their 110105, A third kind of the
same species is remarkable for its scientific method
of constructi0n3 it sets up its warp-threads, and its
own womb suffices to supply the material needed
for this considerable work, whether because the
substance of its intestines is thus resolved at a fixed
time, as Democritus holds,'² or because it has inside

use ofits claw and such a smooth and even thread it
spins the warp, employing itself as a weight. It
starts weaving at the centre, twining in the woof in

unloosable knot‚ spreading them out at intervals
that are always regular but continually grow less
narrow. How skilfully it conceals the suares that
lurk in its checkered net! How unintentional
