maggot developes, and three days later it becomes
a caterpillar‚ which as days are added grows lai-gem
it becomes motionless‚xvith a hard skin‚ and only moves
when touched, being covered with a cobweb growth—
at this stage it is called a chrysalis. Then it bursts
its covering and flies out as a butizerfly.a

XXXVIII. In this way some creatures are
generated from rain in the earth and some even in
wood. For not only is the goatmoth caterpillar born
in wood, but also the horse—fly springs from wood, and
other creatures, wherever there is excessivo damp,
(XXXIX) just as tape-wornis thirty feet in length,
sometimes even more, grow inside a human being.
Again worms b are born in the flesh of dead bodies
and also in the hair ofliving people‚ a foul growth that
caused the death of the dictator Sulla and also of one
of the most famous of Greece poets, Alcman. This
indeed also infests birds, and actually kills pheasants
unless they sprinkle themselves with dust; and of
hairy animals it is believed that only the ass and sheep
are immune from this evil. They ⁶ also breed in one
kind of clothinfg especially, woollen made from sheep
that have been killed by wolves. Also I find in the
authorities that some springs of water in which
we bathe are specially productive of ’this kind
of creature3 inasmuch as even wax generates
what is believed to be the smallest of animals.
Othersd again are generated out of dirt by ’che rays
of the sun, creatures that hop with a frisk of their
hind legs, and others out of damp dust, that fly
about in caves.

season that always lives with its head fixed in the
blood of a host, and consequently goes on sweHing,
