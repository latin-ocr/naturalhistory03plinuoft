to say, after six months of life they melt invisibly
back into mud, and again in the waters of spring·
time are 1··eb01n what they were before, equally
owing to some hidden principle of nature, as it occurs
every year. Also mussels and scallops are produced
by spontaneous generation in sandy waters 3 fish with
harder shells‚ like the two varieties of purple-fish,
are generated by 3 sticky juice like saliva, as gnats
are by moisture turning sour3 the anchovy by sea-
foam growing warm when rain gets into it3 but fish
protected by a flinty covering, like oysters, are
generated by rotting mud, or by the foam round
ships that stay moored for some time, and especially
round stakes fixed 111 1116 gro,und and timber. It
has recently been discovered in oy ster· beds that a
fertilizing moisture flows out of 111636 fish like milk.
Eels rub against rocks and the serapings come to life;
this is their only way of breeding. Different kinds
of fish do not mate together, except the skate and
the ray, the cross between which is like a ray in
front, and bears in Greece a name ‘² derived from the
names of both parents.

Some creatures are born at a fixed season of the

year, water species as well as those on land: scallops ³ea⁸⁰⁷²

and slugs and leeches in the spring3 these also pass
away at a fixed season. Among fish the wolf-fish
and the sardine breed twice a year, and so do all the
roek-fish3 some breed three times, for instance the
herring3 carp six times3 sea-scorpions and sargz'
twice, in spring and autumn: of the flat 11311 only the
skate twice, in the autumn and at the setting of the
Pleiads; most fish in the three months of April,
May and June; the stockfish in the autumn, the
sargus, the torpedo and the squalus at the season
