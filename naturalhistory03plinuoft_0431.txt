by many other creatures. Eagles have clearer
sight, vultures a keener sense of smell, moles acuter
hearing—although they are buried in the earth, so
dense and deaf an element of nature, and although
moreover all sound travels upward‚ they can overhear
people talking, and it is actually said that if you
speak about them they understand and run away.
Among men, when one is first of all denied hearing
he also is robbed of the power of talking, and there
are no persons deas from birth who are not also
dumb. The sea-oyster probably has no sense of
hearing3 but it is said that the razor-shell dives at a
sound: consequently people fishing make a practice
of silence. LXXXIX. Fish indeed have no auditory
organs or passages, but nevertheless it is obvious that
they hear, inasmuch as it can be observed that in some
fishponds wild fish have a habit of flocking together
to be fed at the sound of clapping, and in the
Emperor’s aquarium the various kinds of fish corne
in answer to their names, or in some cases individual
fish. Consequently it is also stated that the mullet,
the wolf-fish‚ the stockfish and the chromis hear very
clearly, and therefore live in shallow water.

XC. It is clearly obvious that fish possess a sense
of smell‚ as they are not all attracted by the same
food, and they smell a thing before they seize it.
Some fish even when hiding in caves are driven out
by a fisherman who smears the mouth of the crag
with brine used in pickling—they run away as it
were from the recognition of their own dead body3
and they also flock together from the deep water to
certain smells, for instance a burnt cuttle-fish or
polyp, which are thrown into wicker creels for this
purpose. Indeed the stench of a ship's bilge makes
