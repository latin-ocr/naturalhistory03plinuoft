the day on which King Pyrrhus dieda the heads of

his victims when cut off crawled about lieking up
their own blood. In man the chief internal organs
are separated from the lower part of the viscera by
a membrane which is called the praecordia (dia-
phragm), because it is stretched prae (in front of)
the cor (lieart): the Greek word for it is plzreneS.
Indeed provident Nature has enclosed all the prin-
cipal internal organs with special membranes serving
as sheaths ; but in the case ofthis membrane a special
cause also was the proximity of the bowels, to pre—
vent the food from pressing down on the vital prin-
ciple. To this membrane unquestionably is due the
subtilty of the intellect; it consequently has no
flesh, but is of a spare sinewy substance. In it also
is the chief seat of merriment, a fact that is gathered
chiefly from tickling the arm-pits to which it rises,
as nowhere else is the human skin thinner, and conse·
quently the pleasure of scratching is closest there.
On this account there have been cases in battle and
in gladiatorial shows of death caused by piei-cing the
diaphragm that has been accompanied by laughter.
LXXVIII. In creatures possessing a stomach the

abdomen is below it; it 15 single in the other species α

but double in the ruminants. Species without blood
have no stomach, because in some, for instance the
cuttle-fish and the polyp‚'’ the intestine beginning at
the mouth bends back to the same point. In man
the abdomen is connected with the bottom of the
stomach, like the dog’s. These are the only animals
in which it is narrower at the lower part, and con-
sequently they are the only ones that vomit, because
when the abdomen is full this narrowness prevents
the food from passing, which cannot happen to those
