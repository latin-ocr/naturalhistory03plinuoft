getting into their uncovered tanks from the open sea
and there foraging for salted fish—even the smell of
which attracts all sea creatur-es in a surprising way,
owing to which even fish-traps are smeared with
them-and so it brought on itself the wrath of the
keepers‚ which owing to the persistence of the theft
was beyond all bounds Fences were erected in its
way, but it used to scale these by making use of a
tree, and it was only possible to catch it by means
of the keen scent of hounds. These surrounded it
when it was going back at night, and aroused the
guards, who were astounded by its strangeness:
in the first place its size was unheard of and so was
its colour as well, and it was snieared with brine and
had a terrible smell3 who would have expected to
find a polyp there, or who would recognize it in such
circumstances? They felt they were pitted against
something uncanny‚ for by its awful breath it also
tormented the dogs, which it now scourged with the
ends of its tentacles and now struck with its longer
arms,which it used as clubs3 and with difficulty they
succeeded in despatching it with a number of three-
pronged harpoons. They showed its head to
Lucullus—it was as big as a cask and held 90 gallons,
-and (to use the words of Trebius himself) ‘its
beards which one could hardly clasp round with both
one's arms, knotted like (stubs, 30 ft. long, with
suckers or cups lil·e basins holding three gallons, and
teeth corresponding to its size. ’ Its remains, kept
as a curiosity, were found to weigh 700 lbs. Trebius sla-<1⁸⁶¹ nte-
also states that cuttle— fish of both species of the
same size have been driven ashore on that coast.
In our own seas one kind is taken that measures
7} ft. in length and the other kind 3 ft. These fish
also do not live more than two years.
