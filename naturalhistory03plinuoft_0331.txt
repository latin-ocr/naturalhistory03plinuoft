XVI. Night birds also have hooked talons‚ for own.
instance the little owl, the eagle-owl and the
screech-owl. All of these are dim-sighted in the
daytime. The eagle-owl is a funereal bird, and is
regarded as an extremely bad omen, especially at
public auspices; it inhabits deserts and places that
are not merely unfrequented but terrifying and
inaccessible3 a wierd creature of the night, its cry
is not a musical note but a scream. Consequenlty
when seen in cities or by daylight in any circum-
stances it is a direful portent3 but Ι know several
cases of its having perched on the houses of private
persons without fatal consequences. It never flies
in the direction where it wants to g0‚ but travels
slantwise out of its course. In the consulship α of
Sextus Palpellius Hister and Lucius Pedanius an
eagle-owl entered the very shrine of the Capitol, on
account of which a purification of the city was held
on March 7th in that year.

XVII. There is also a bird of ill-omen called the Unknoum
fite—bird, on account of which we find in the annals ξ’ἦᾞξηζζ,
that the city has often had a ritual purification, for
instance in the consulshipb of Lucius Cassius and
Gaius Marius, in which year the appearance of an
eagle-owl also occasioned a purification. What this
bird was I cannot discover, and it is not recorded.
Some persons give this interpretation, that the
fite-bird was any bird that was seen carrying a coal
from an altar or altar-table3 others call it a
‘ spinturnix‚' ⁶ but I have not found anybody who
professes to know what particular species of bird
that is. I also notice that the bird named by the
ancients ‘ clivia ' is unidentified—some call it
⁴ screech-owl,' Labeo ‘ warning owl '3 and moreover
