ean in the daytime, and that consequently a diet of
goat's liver restores twilight sight to persons suffering
from what is called night-blindness. In Cilicia and
the Syrtes region people wear clothes made of hair
shorn from goats. They say that she-goats in the
pastures when the sun is setting do not look at one

though at other times of the day they lie facing each
other and take notice of one another. From the
chin of all goats hangs a tuft of hair called their

this also happens as well when one of them nibbles a
particular plant. Their bite kills a tree3 they make
an olive tree barren even by lieking it, and for this

litters number up to 20, but sows cannot rear so

the remedy is not to allow coupling at the first heat
or before the ears are pendulous. Hogs cannot

sacrifice four days after birth, a lamb in a week and a
calf in a month. Coruncanius asserted that ruminant
animals are not acceptable as victims before they grow
