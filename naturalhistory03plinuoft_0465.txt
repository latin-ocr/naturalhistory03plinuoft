BOOK XI. x. 24—x1. 27

However in a wind against them they fly close to the
ground, carefully avoiding the brambles. They keep
a wonderful watch on the work in hand3 they mark
the idleness of any who are slack and chastise them,
and later even punish them with death. They are
wonderfully clean: they remove everything out
of the way and no refuse is left lying among their
work3 indeed the droppings of those working inside
are heaped in one place so that they may not have
to retire too far, and they carry them out on stormy
days and when work is suspended. When evening
approaches, the buzzing inside the hive grows less
and less, till one bee flies round as though giving
the order to take repose with the same loud buzz
with which she woke them, and this in the manner
of a military camp; thereupon they all suddenly
become quiet.

They build homes for the commonalty first, and ns rzcc νι

for the kingsa afterwards. If a specially large
production of honey is expected, quarters are added
for the drones as well, · these are the smallest of the
cells, but those for the worker- bees themselves are

larger XI. The drones ὸ have no stings, being so to ἔνθηρτξονι

say imperfect bees and the new est made, the mcom-
plete product of those that are exhausted and now
discharged from service, a late brood, and as it were
the servants of the true bees, who consequently
order them about, and drive them out first to the
w,orks punishing laggards without mercy. And
the drones are of service to the bees not only in
work but also when breeding, as their crowd

begins to fail in autumn, they are killed and cast out of the
colony by the worker-bees. The workers are iemales not
specialized like the queens for reproduction.
