LIV. Bears couple at the beginning of winter, Thebear.
and not in the usual manner of quadrupeds but both
lying down and hugging each other3 afterwards
they retire apart into caves, in which they give birth
on -the thirtieth day to a litter of five eubs at most.
These are a white and shapeless lump of ssesh,
little larger than inice, without eyes or hair and only
the claws projecting. This lump the mother bears
slowly lick into shape. Nor is anything more unusual
than to see a she-bear giving birth to cubs. Con-
sequently the males lie in hiding for periods of forty
days, and the females four months. If they have
not got caves, they build rainproof dens by heaping
up branches and brushwood, with a carpet of soft
foliage on the floor. For the first fortnight they sleep
so soundly that they cannot be aroused even by
woundsÍ¾ at this period they get fat with sloth to a
remarkable degree (the beai-'s grease is useful for
medicines and a prophylactic against baldness).
As a result of these days of sleep they shrink in bulk
and they live by sucking their fore paws. They
cherish their freezing offspring by prcssing thern to
their breast, lying on them just like birds hatching
eggs. Strange to say, Theophrastus believes that
even boiled bear's flesh, if kept, goes on growing
in size for that period3 that no evidence of food and
only the smallest amount of water is found in the
belly at this stage, and that there arc only a few
drops of blood in the neighbourhood of the heart
and none in the rest of the body. In the spring
they come out, but the males are very fat, a fact
the cause of which is not evident, as they have not
been fattened up even by sleep, except for a fortnight
as we have said. On coming out they devour a plant
