BOOK XI. va. 172-174

to madness when their saliva gets through to the
blood. We have spokena of the tongues of the

purple-fishes. In frogs the tip of the tongue is ν

attached but the inner part is loose from the throat;
it is with this that the males croak, at the time when
they are called croakers3 this happens at a fixed
seasom when they are calling the females to mate.
In this process they just drop the lower lip and take
into the throat a moderate amount of vater and let
the tongue vibrate in it so as to make it undulate,
and a croaking sound is forced out; during this
the curves of the cheeks are distended and become
transparent, and the eyes stand out blazing with
the exertion. Creatures with stings in their hindei·
part have teeth and a tongue as well, bees even a
very long tongue, and cicalas also a projecting one3
but those with a tubular sting in the mouth have
neither tongue nor teeth. Some insects have a
tongue inside the mouth, for instance ants3 more-
over, the elephant's tongue also is particularly little
visible. With the rest of the animals according to
their kind the tongue is always quite free, but with
man alone it is often so tightly bound by veinsb
that they have to be cut. We find it recorded
that the High Priest Metellus was so tongue-tied
that he is believed to have suffered torture for
many months while practising the formula to be
spoken in dedicating the Temple of Wealth3 but
in all other cases of stammering the patient usually
contrives to speak distinctly after reaching the age
of six. Many people on the other hand are en-
dowed with such skill in using the tongue that they
can give imitations of the cries of birds and animals
that are indistinguishable from the real thing.
