to contribute something to the whiteness in women's
skin; at all events Domitius Nero’s wife Poppaea
used to drag five hundred she asses with foals about
with her everywhere and actually soaked her whole
body in a bath-tub with ass’s milk, believing that
it also smoothed out wrinkles. All milk is made
thicker by fire and turned into whey by cold.
Cow’s milk makes more cheese than goat’s milk,
almost as much again from the same quantity.
Animals with more than four dugs are not serviceable

The curds of the roebuck, hare and goat are
praised, but that of the rabbit is the best, and is even
a cure for diarrhoea—the rabbit is the only animal
with teeth in both jaws that has this property. It
is remarkable that the foreign races that live on
milk for so many centuries have not known or have ,
despised the blessing of cheese, at most condensing ’
their milk into agreeable sour curds and fat butter.
Butter is a foam of milk of thicker and stickier sub—
stance than what is called whey; it must be added
that it possesses the quality of oil and is used for²
anointing by all foreigners and by ourselves in the
case of children.

highly praised at Rome, where the good things of
all nations are estimated at first hand, is that of
the district of Nimes, coming from the villages of La
Lozere and Gevaud3n3 but it only wins approval for
a short time and when fresh. The Alps prove the
value of their pastures by two kinds of cheese: the
Dalmatiam Mountains send the Docleate and the
Tarentaise the Vatusic. A larger number belong
to the Apennines: these send Coebanum cheese
