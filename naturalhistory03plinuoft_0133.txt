prefer mares as chargers, because they can make
water without checking their gallop.

LXVII. It is known that in Lusitaniaa in the

neighbourhood of the town of Lisbon and the river a ι ²

facing towards it and conceive the breath of life and
that this produces a soal, and this is the way to
breed a very swift colt, but it does not live more than
three years. Also in Spain the Gallaic and Asturian
tribes breed those of the horse kind that we call
‘theldones,’ though when more of a pony type
they are designated ‘cobs'‚ which have not the
usual paces in running but a smooth trot, straightening
the near and off-side legs alternately, from which the
horses are taught by training to adopt an ambling
pace.

The horse has nearly the same diseases as mankind, semes os

all beasts os the draft class.

LXVIII. Marcus Varro states that an ass was
bought for the senator Quintus Axius at 400‚000
sesterces? which perhaps beats the price paid for any

make worse sires when not in work. The females
breed at two and a half years old at earliest, but
