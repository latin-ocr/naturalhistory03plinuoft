BOOK XI. an. 163—Lxm. 166

The most accurate authorities write that this poison
is nothing else than the serpents’ gall, and that veins
pass from the gall-bladder under the spine to the
mouth3 certain writers say that it is only one tooth,
and that as it is hooked it is sloped backward when it
has inflicted a bite3 some authorities state that it
then falls out and afterwards grows again, as it is
very easy to dislodge‚ and that the snakes that we
see handleda lack this tooth3 and that the scorpion
has this tooth in its tail-—as according to most
authorities it has three. The vipers' teeth are
concealed in its gum. Their gum is charged with
the same poison, and when squeezed by the pressure
of the teeth pours out its venom into the bites
inflicted. No winged creature except the bat has

teeth. The camel is the only animal without horns ⁸

that has not got front teeth in the upper jaw. No
horned animal has serrated teeth. Even snails
have teeth; this is proved by the fact that even the
smallest of them gnaw vetches. But I wonder
what possible ground there is for the view that
among marine species shell-fish and cartilaginous
fish have front teeth, and also that sea—urchins have
five. Insects have stings instead of teeth. The
monkey has teeth like those of a human being. The
elephant has four inner teeth for masticating, and
besides these the prominent tusks that are bent
baekward in the male and slope straight downward
in the female. The sea-mouse that swims in front
of the whale has no teeth, but instead of them its
mouth inside and also its tongue and palate are set
with bristles. Of land animals very small quadrupeds

have two extremely long front teeth in each jaw.
