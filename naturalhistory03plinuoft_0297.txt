LXXXII. Ponds for keeping snails were first made ἔπαὲῑῑ
by Fulvius Lippinus in the Trachina district a little ree ’Μ’
before the civil wara fought with Pompey the Great3
indeed he kept the different kinds of snails separate,
with different compartments for the white snails
that grow in the Rieti territory and for the Illyrian
variety distinguished for size‚ the African for
fecundity and the Solitane for breed. Moreover he
devised a method of fattening them with new wine
boiled down and spelt and other kinds of fodder,
so that gastronomy was enriched even by sattened
oysters; and according to Marcus Varro this osten-
tatious science was carried to such lengths that
a single snail-shell was large enough to hold 80

q LXXXIII. Moreover some wonderful kinds of fish Renzfzrlcable
are reported by Theophrastus. He says that (l) smfflflm
where the rivers debouch around the water-meadows
of Babylon a certain fish b stays in caverns that contain
springs and goes out from them to seed, walking with
its fins by means of a repeated movement of the tail,
and guards against being caught by taking refuge in
its caves and remaining in thern facing towards the
opening, and that these fishes’ heads resemble a sea—
frog’s and the rest of its parts a goby's, though the
gills are the same as in other fish. (2) In the neigh-
bourhood of Heraclea and Cromna and in many
parts of the Black Sea there is one kind that fre-
quents the water at the edge of rivers and makes
itself caverns in the ground and lives in these, and
also in the shore of tidal rivers when left dry by the
tide3 and consequently they are only dug up when
the movement of their bodies shows that they are

alive. (3) In the same neighbourhood of Heraclea
