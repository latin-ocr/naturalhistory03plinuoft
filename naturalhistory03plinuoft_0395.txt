vocal, though when caught it keeps silent. It was
once considered one of the rare birds, but now it also
occurs in Gaul and Spain. It is even caught in the
neighbourhood of the Alps, where also cormorants
occur, a bird specially belonging to the Balearic

that only differs from quails in size‚ yellow-coloured‚

Governor of the Alps, has stated that also the ibis,
which properly belongs to Egypt7 has been seen by

above. In those islands the buzzard of the hawk family
is also in repute for the table, and the vipio as well-—
that is their name for the smaller crane.

part I think the same about the beai-ded eagled
