BOOK VIII. V. 9—10

that they know why they are hunted, but also that Elephan&
almost all know what they must beware of. It is said {egga
that when an elephant accidentally meets a human
being who is merely wandering across its track in a
solitary place it is good-tempered and peaceful and
will actually show the way ; but that when on the other
hand it notices a man's footprint before it sees the
man himself it begins to tremble in sear of an ambush,
stops to sniff the scent, gazes round, trumpets
angrily, and avoids treading on the footprint but
digs it up and passes it to the next elephant, and
that one to the following, and on to the last of all
with a similar message, and then the column wheels
round and retires and a battle line is formed: since
the smell in question lasts to be scented by them all,
though in the majority of cases it is not even the
smell of bare feet. Similarly a tigress also, it is
said, even though savage to all other animals and
herself scorm‘ng the footprints even of an elephant,
when she sees the track of a human being at once
carries her cubs elsewhere—though how has she
recognized or where has she seen before the person
that she fears? For it is certain that such forests are
very little frequented, Granted that no doubt they
may be surprised by the mere rarity of the print3
but how do they know that it is something to be
afraid of ? Indeed there is a further point, why
should they dread even the sight of a man himself
when they excel him so greatly in strength, size and
speed? Doubtless it is Nature’s law and shows her
power, that the fiercest and largest wild beasts may
have never seen a thing that they ought to sear and
yet understand immediately when they have to
fear it.
