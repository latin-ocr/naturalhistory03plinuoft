referred to. They build their nests in rocks and

they shut out two chicks of the blood, and h ave been

young of all the wild animals should not be plundered 3
also during those days the birds' talons turn inward,
and their feathers grow white from want of food, so
that with good reason they hate their own offspring.
But the chicks thrown out by these birds are received

pursues them even when grown up, and drives them
far away, doubtless because they are competitors in
the chase. And apart from this a single pair of eagles
in order to get enough food requires a large tract of

carry it off at once, but first lay it on the ground, and
