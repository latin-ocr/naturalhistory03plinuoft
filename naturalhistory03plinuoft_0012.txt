PREFACE

TRANSLATIONS are usually designed either to present
the thought of a foreign writer in the English most
appropriate to it, vm'thout regard to the peculiarities
of his style (so far as style and thought can be djs-
tinguished)‚ or, on the contrary, to convey to the
English reader‚ as far as is possible, the style as well
as the thought of the foreign original.

It would seem, however, that neither of these
objects should be the primary aim of a translator
constructing a version that is to be printed facing the
original text. In these circumstances the purpose
of the version is to assist the reader of the original
to understand its meaning. This modest intention
must guide the choice of a rendering for each phrase
or sentence, and considerations of English style are
of necessity seeondary.

A few biographieal notes on persons mentioned
by the author will be found in the index.
