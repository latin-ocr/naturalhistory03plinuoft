Aristomenes who killed three hundred Spartans.
He himself when severely wounded and taken
prisoner for the first time escaped through a cave
from confinement in the quarries by following the
routes by which foxes got in. He was again taken
prisoner, but when his guards were fast asleep he
rolled to the fire and burnt off his thongs, burning
his body in the process. He was taken a third time,
and the Spartans cut him open alive and his heart
was found to be shaggy.

LXXI. In victims whose organs are propitious Tfiq heqrtzae
there is a certain fatness on the top of the heart. ‘²¹²'¹⁷²‘¹²'⁰⁷³·
But the heart was not always considered as one of
the significant organs; it was after the 126th
Olympiad, when Lucius Postumius Albinus, son of
Lucius, was King of Sacrifices, after King Pyrrhus
had evacuated Italy‚‘¹ that the augurs began to
inspect the heart among the organs. On the day
when Caesar as dictator first went in procession
dressed in purple and took his seat on a golden
throne, when he performed a sacrifice the heart was
lacking among the organs; and this gave rise to
much debate among the students of divination, as
to whether the victim had been able to live without
that organ or had lost it at the time. It is stated
that at the cremation of persons who have died of
heart disease the heart cannot be burnt, and the
same is said of persons that have been killed by
poison; undoubtedly there is extant a speech of
Vitellius that employs this argument to prove Gnaeus
Piso guilty of poisoning‚'’ and explicitly uses the evi-
dence that it had been impossible to cremate the heart
of Germanicus Caesar on account of poison. In reply

Piso's defence was based on the nature of the disease.
