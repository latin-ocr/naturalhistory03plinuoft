Geese mate in the water3 they lay in spring, or Matina os

if they mated in midwinter‚ after midsummer3 they
lay nearly 40 eggs, twice in a year if the hens turn the
first brood out of the nest otherwise sixteen eggs
V at the most and seven at the few est. If somebody
removes the eggS‚ they go on laying till they burst.
They do not turn strange eggs out eof the nest. It

ones, for instance the kite and hawk, sit for twenty
days. A kite's brood usually numbers two chicks,
never more than three, that of the bird called the
merlin as many as four, and the raven’s occasionally
even five; they sit for the same number of days.
The hen crow is fed by the cock while sitting. The
magpie's brood numbers nine, the blackcap’sb over
twenty and always an odd number, and no other
bird has a larger brood: so much more prolific are
