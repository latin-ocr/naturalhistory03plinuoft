Where there are sinews, the inner ones contract the
limbs and the ones on the surface reverse the move-

millXXXIX. Between the sinews lie the arteries, dwv &432³

which are the passages for the breath, and on
these float the veins, which are the channels for
the blood. The pulse of the arteries being parti-
cularly evident at the extremity of the h'mbs is
usually a sign of diseases; with remarkable scientific
skill it has been reduced by that high priest of
medicine, Herophilus, to definite rhythms and
metrica] rules throughout the periods of life—steady
or hurried or slow. This sign α 1135 been neglected

of the pulse-beat, rapid 01· languid. The arteries
have no sensation‚ for they even are without blood,
nor do they all contain the breath of life3 and when
they are cut only the part of the body concerned is
paralysed. Birds have not got either veins or
arteries, nor yet have snakes, tortoises and lizards‚

that of females‚ and that of youth than that of old
age; and it is thicker in the lower part of the body.
The blood also contains a large proportion of vitality,
