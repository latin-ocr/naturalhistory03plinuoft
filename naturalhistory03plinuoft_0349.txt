the night-time, and although they fly to and fro
across the country, it is thought that they have never
arrived anywhere except by night. There is a place
in Asia called Snakesdorp with a wide expanse of
plains where cranes meet in assembly to hold a
palaver‚ and the one that arrives last they set upon
with their claws, and so they depart3 it has been
noticed that they have not frequently been seen there
after the first fortnight of August. Some persons
declare that storks have no tongue. They are held
in such high esteem for destroying snakes that in
Thessaly to kil] them was a capital crime, for which
the legal penalty was the same as for homicide.

XXXII. Geese and swans also migrate on a similar
principle, but the ssight of these is seen. They travel
in a pointed formation like fast gasseys, so cleaving
the air more easily than if they drove at it with a
straight front3 while in the rear the ssight stretches
out in a gradually widening wedge, and presents a
broad surface to the drivc of a following breeze. They
place their necks on the birds in front of them,
and when the leaders are tired they receive them
to the rear. (Storks return to the same nest.
They nourish their parents’ old age in their turn.) α
Α story is told about the mournful song of swans at
their death—-a false story as I judge on the strength
of a certain number of experiencesss' Swans are
cannibals‚ and eat one another's flesh.

XXXIII. But this migration of birds of passage
over seas and lands does not allow us to postpone
the smaller breeds as well that have a similar nature.
For however much the size and strength of body of
the kinds above mentioned may appear to invite
them to travel, the quails always actually arrive
