BOOK XI. Lxxm. 190-Lxxv. 193

removes anxieties. Hares with two livers are found
in the district of Briletum and Tharnes and in
the Chersonese on the Sea of Marmara, and surprising
to say, when the animals are moved to another place

one of the two livers disappears.

LXXIV. The liver also contains the gall· -bladder, fflssddaa*

but not all animals possess one. At Chalcis in
Euboea the cattle have none, while at Naxos they
have a very large double one, so that both facts seem
portentous to a strangena Horses, mules, asses,
stags, wild goats, boars, camels and dolphins have
not got one ; some mice have. Among human beings
few lack one; those who do are exceptionally strong
in health and long-lived. Some think that the horse
has a gall-bladder not indeed in the liver but in the
belly‚ and that the stag has one in the tail or in the
bowels, and that consequently they have such a
bitter flavour that dogs will not touch them. But
as a matter of fact it is only excrement, and because
of this the substance of this part also contains the
worst portion of the blood. Unquestionably only
sanguineous animals possess a liver. The liver
receives the blood from the heart with which it is
connected, and passes it into the veins.

LXXV. But with a human being black gall contains {³³ ξέἔῗὲῇω
the cause of insanity, and when it is all excreted osqa all.
death follows. Hence the reproach made against a
man ’5 chalacter under the term ‘bile : so powerful
a poison is contained in this part when it spreads to
the mind. Moreover when it is diffused all over the
body it takes away the colour even of the eyes, and
indeed, when excreted, even from bronze vessels?
which turn black when touched by it—so that no-

body need be surprised that snakes' gall is poison.
