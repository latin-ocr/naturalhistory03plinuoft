BOOK X. x1. 25-27

XI. The cuckoo seems to be made by changing its
shape out of a hawk α at a celtain season of the year,
as the rest of the hawks do not appear then, excepth
on a very few days, and the cuckoo itself also afterha
being seen for a moderate period of the summer is
not observed afterwards. But the cuckoo is alone
among the hawks in not having crooked talons‚ and
also it is not like the other hawks in the head or in
anything else but colour: it rather has the general
appearance of the pigeon. Moreover a hawk will
eat a cuckoo, if ever both have appeared at the same

dates it lays its eggs in the nests of other birds,
usuallyc wood- -pigeons‚ for the most part one egg at a
time, as does no other bird; it seldom lays two. Its
reason for foisting its chicks on other birds is supposed
to be that it knows itself to be hated by the whole of
the birds, for even the very small birds attack it3
consequently it thinks that a progeny will not be
secured for its race unless it has eseaped notice, for
which reason it makes no nest3 it is a timid creature
in general. Therefore the brooding hen in the nest
thus cuckolded rears the changeling. The young
cuckood being by nature greedy snatches the bits of
food away from the rest of the chicks, and so gets fat
and attracts the mother bird to itself by its sleek
appearance. She delights in its beauty and admires
herself for having borne such a child, while in
comparison with it she convicts her own chicks of
not belonging to her, and lets them be eaten up
even under her own eyeS‚ until finally the cuckoo,
