BOOK VIII. L. 113-116

the hunters draw near again seeking refuge in
flight: this is done owing to pain in the gut, which
is so weak that a light blow causes interna] rupture.
But when they hear the baying of hounds they always
run away down wind, so that their scent may go away
with them. They can be charmed by a shepherd’s

it is thought that they bury them. The smell of
either horn when burnt arrests attacks of epilepsy.
They also bear marks of their age in their horns,
each year till they are six years old adding one tine;
