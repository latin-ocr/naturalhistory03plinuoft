states that if you drive a nail or wedge with as much
force as you like into a tree in which a woodpecker
has a nest, when the bird perches on it it at once
springs out again with a ereak of the tree. Wood·
peckers themselves have been of the first importance
among auguries in Latium from the time of the king α

who gave his name to this bird. One presage of

theirs Ι cannot pass over. When Aelius Tubero,
City Praetor, was giving judgements from the bench
in the forum, a woodpecker perched on his head so
fearlessly that he was able to catch it in his hand.
In reply to enquiry the seers declared that disaster
was portended to the empire ifthe bird were released‚
but to the praetor if it were killed. Tubero however
at once tore the bird in pieces3 and not long after-

and fruit, but those that eat only flesh do not drink,
excepting the kite, and for a kite to drink counts in

never live in flocks, and each hunts for itself. But
they almost all except the night-birds among them
fly high, and the bigger ones higher. All have large
wings and a small body. They walk with difficulty.
They rarely perch on rocks, as the curve of their
talons prohibits this.

XXII. Now let us speak about the second class ὁ,
which is divided into two kinds, song-birds and
plumage-birds.⁶ The former kind are distinguished
by their song and the latter by their size3 so the
latter shall corne first in order also, and among them
