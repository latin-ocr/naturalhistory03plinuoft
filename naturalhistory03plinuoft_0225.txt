one that is most skilful in making his master bank-
rupt. Licinius Mucianus has recorded the capture
in the Red Sea of 3 mullet weighing 80 lbs.; what
price would our epicures have paid for it if it had

been found on the coasts near the city?
XXXII It is also a fact of nature that differentm

fishes hold the first rank in different places—the asze

blackfish in Egypt, the John Dory (3150 called the
carpenter— fish) at Cadiz, the stockfish in the neigh-
bourhood of Iviza, though elsewhere it is a disgusting
fish, and everywhere 0it is unable to be cooked
thoroughly unless it has been beaten with a rod; in
Aquitaine the river salmon is preferred to all sea-fish.

XXXIII. Some fish have numerous gius, others
single ones, others double. With the gills they
discharge the water taken in by the mouth.
Hardening of the scales, which are not alike in all
fishes, is a sign of age. There are two lakes in
Italy at the foot of the Alps, named Como and
Maggiore, in which every year at the rising of the
Pleiadsa fish are found that 316 remarkable for
close-set and very sharp scales, shaped like 51106-
113115, but they are not commonly seen for a longer
period than about a month from then.

XXXIV. Arcadia also has a marvel in its climbing
perch? so called because it climbs out on to the
land to sleep. In the district of the river Clitorius
this fish is said to have a voice and no gills3 the
same variety is by some people called the Adonis fish.

XXXV. The fish called the sea-mouse also comes out
on to the land, 35 do the polypus and the lamprey;
so also does 3 certain kind of fish in the rivers of
India, and then jumps back again—for in most
cases there is an obvious purpose in getting across into
