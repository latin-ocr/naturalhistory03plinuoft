creatures have, nor anything that can properly be
termed a skin, but a substance of a nature inter-
mediate between all of these, as it were dried up,
softer in the sinew but harder or rather more dui-able
in all the other parts. And this is all that they
possess, and nothing else in addition3 they have
no internal organs except, in the case of quite a
few, a twisted intestine. Consequently when torn

and the separate parts go on throbbing, because
whatever their vital principle is it certainly does
not reside in particular members but in the body as
a whole—least of all in the head, and this alone
does not move unless it has been torn off with the
breast. No other kind of creature has a greater
number of feet, and of this species the ones that
have more feet live longer when torn asunder, as we
see in the case of the multipede. But they possess
eyes, and also of the other senses touch and taste,
and some have smell as well, and a few hearing also.

the domesticated nor to the wild class. Nature is
