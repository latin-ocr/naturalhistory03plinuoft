three years old, nor in old age, and they do not serve
for more than four years. They begin when six
months old and before they are weaned. Both
sexes breed better with the horns removed. The
first coupling in the day has no result, but the
following and subsequent ones are more effectual.
She—goats conceive in November so as to bear kids
in March when the bushes are budding—yearlings

They go on bearing for eight years. They are liable
to miscarriage from cold. A she-goat cures its eyes
when bloodshot by pricking them on a rush, he—goats
