mares that have been broken are in heat 60 days
sooner than those running with the herd ; that swine
only foam at the mouth when mating3 that when a
boar-pig has heard a sow in heat grunting it refuses
food to the point of losing flesh entirely unless it is ad-
mitted to her, while sows get so fierce that they will
gore a human being, especially one wearing white
clothes. This madness can be reduced by sprinkling
the organs with vinegar. It is believed that desire
for mating is also stimulated by articles of diet, for
instance rocket in the case of a man and onions in the
case of cattle. It is a remarkable fact that wild species
when domesticated refuse to breed, for instance wild
geese‚ and wild boars and stags do so reluctantly and
only if they have been reared from infancy. Female
animals refuse intercourse when pregnant, except
the mare and the sow; but only the common rabbit
and the hairy-footed rabbit allow superfetation.
LXXXIV. All viviparous species produce their
young head foremost‚ the embryo turning round
shortly before delivery‚ but otherwise lying stretched
at length in the womb. Four-footed species are
carried with the legs stretched out to full length and
folded against their own belly, but the human embryo
curled up in a hall, with the nostrils placed between
the two kneesfl It is thought that moon calves,
about which we have spoken beforeJ’ are produced
when a woman has conceived not from a male but
from herself alone, and that they do not come
alive because they are not produced from two parents,
and they possess the sels—nourishing vitality that
belongs to plants and trees. Of all the species
bearing fully developed offspring pigs alone have
litters that are numerous as well as developed, for it
