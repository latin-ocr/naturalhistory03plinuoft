regularly from three; they can breed as many
times as mares, and in the same months and in 3
similar way. But the womb cannot retain the
genita] fluid but discharges it, unless the animal is
whipped into a gallop after coupling. It seldom
bears twins. When about to bear a foal it shuns
the sunlight and seeks the shadow‚ so as not to bc
seen by a human being. It breeds through all its
lifetime, which is thirty years. It has a very great
affection forits young, but 3 greater dislike for water:
she-asses will go through fire to their foals, but yet
if the smallest stream intervenes they are afraid of
merely wetting their hooves. Those kept in pasture3
will only drink at springs they are used to, and where
they can get to drink by a dry track; and they will
not go across bridges with interstices in their structure
allowing the gleam of the river to be seen through
them3 and, surprising to say, they may be thirsty
and have to be forced or coaxed to drink, if the stream
is not the one they are used to. Only a wide allow—

for when asleep they have a variety of dreams and
frequently let out with their hooves, which at once
causes lameness by hitting timber that is too hard
unless they have plenty of room to kick in. The
profit made out of she-asses „surpasses the richest
spoils of war. It is known that in Celtiberia their
foals have made 400‚000 sesterces⁰ per dam‚especially
when mules are bred. They say that in she-asses
the hair of the ears and the eye-lids is an important
point, for although the rest of the dam’s body is all
one colom, the foal reproduces all the colours that
were in those places. Maecenas set the fashion
of eating donkey foals at banquets, and they were
