his body of its armour‚ his horse kicked him and bit
him till he died; another horse, when its blinkers
were removed and it found out that a mare it had
covered was its dam, made for a precipice and com-
mitted suicide. We read that an ostler in the Reate
district was savaged by a horse for the same reason.
For horses actually understand the ties of relation-
ship, and a filly in a herd is even fonder of going
with a sister a year older than with their dam.
Their docility is so great that we learn that the entire
cavalry of the army of Sybaris used to perform a sort
of ballet to the music of a band. The Sybarite
horses also know beforehand when there is going to
be a battle, and when they lose their masters mourn
for them: sometimes they shed tears at the bereave-
ment. When King Nicomedes was killed his horse
ended its life by refusing food. Phylarchus records
that when Antiochus fell in battle one of the Galatians
Centaretus caught his horse and mounted it in
triumph, but it was fired with indignation and taking
the bit between its teeth so as to become unmanage-
able, galloped headlong to a precipice where it
perished with its rider. Philistus records that
Dionysius left his horse stuck in a bog, and when
it extricated itself it followed its master’s tracks
with a swarm of bees clinging to its mane3 and that
in consequence of this portent Dionysius seized the
tyranny.

lying on the ground and pass them to their rider.
