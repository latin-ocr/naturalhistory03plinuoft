back and when it holds its head on one side in
walking. If too fat they experience lack of milk3
and they have a smaller number of pigs in their

60 days to fasten, but fatten better if feeding up
is preceded by three days’ fast. The pig is the

of treating the liver of sows as of geese, a discovery
of Marcus Apicius—they are stuffed with dried fig,
