blood retreats and is nowhere to be found, and that
many creatures do not shed blood when stabbed‚ which
happens only to a human being. For those which we
have spoken of a as changing their colour really
assume the colour of some other object by a sort of
reflexi0n3 only man actually changes colour in
himself. All diseases and death reduce the amount
of blood.

XCII. There are persons who think that subtlety Ρενοᾷο-
of mind is not due to thinness of the blood, but that phy³²⁰²⁰w
animals are more or less brutish owing to their skin
and bodily coverings‚ as for instance molluscs and tor-
toises ; and that the hides of oxen and bristles of pigs
obstruet the thinness of the air when being inhaled,
and it is not transmitted pure and liquid; so also in
man, when his skin being thicker or more callous
shuts it out—just as if crocodiles did not possess both
a hard hide and cunning. XCIII. The skin of the
hippopotamus is so thick that it is used for the points
of spears, and yet its mind possesses a certain medical
ability.⁶ The hides of elephants also supply im-
penetrable bucklers (though nevertheless they are
credited with the most outstanding mental subtlety
of all quadrupeds) 3 and consequently their skin itself
is devoid of sensation, especially in the head. It
does not heal up when wounded in any place where
there is only skin and no flesh, as in the cheek and
e elid.

yXCIV. Viviparous species have bristles, but ovi- Bristles,
parous ones have feathers or scales, or shells like {ssffissssw απ(
tortoises, or bare skin like snakes. Feathers in all

cases have hollow stalks3 when cut off they do not

grow again, but when plucked out others grow in

their place. Insects use fragile membranes to fly
