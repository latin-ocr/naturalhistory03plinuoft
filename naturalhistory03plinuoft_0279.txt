derived from both, possess sense-perception-—I mean
jelly-fish and sponges.

Jelly-fish roam about and change their place by
night. These have the nature of a fleshy leaf, and
they seed on flesh. The itch they cause has a biting
power,just like that of the land nettle. Consequently
this creature draws itself in as stiffly as possible and
when a little fish swims in front of it spreads out its
leaf and enfolding it devours it. In other cases it
looks as if it were withering up, and allows itself to
be tossed about by the waves like seaweed, and
attacks any fish that touch it as they try to serape
away the itch by rubbing against a rock. The same
creature by night hunts for scallops and sea-urchins.
When it feels a hand approach it, it changes colour
and draws itself together. &Vhen touched it sends
out a burning sting, and if there is a moment’s
interval hides. It is reported to have mouths in its
root and to evacuate its excretions by a narrow tube
through its topmost parts.

LXIX. We are informed that there are three
kinds of sponge: a thick and very hard and rough
one is called goat-thorn sponge, a less thick and
softer one loose-sponge‚ and a thin one of close
texture, used for making paint-brushes‚ Achilles
sponge. They all grow on rocks, and feed on shells,
flsh and mud. These creatures manifestly possess
intelligence, because when they are aware of a sponge-
gatherer they contract and make it much more
difficult to detach thern. They do the same when
much beaten by the waves, The tiny shells found
inside them clearly show that they live by eating
food. It is said that in the neighbourhood of Torone
they can be fed on these shell-fish even after they
