are then specially' rough. They seed at night.
They are the only fish that do not float on the
sui-face when dead. There is a lake called Garda
in the territory of Verona through which flows the
river Mincio, at the outflow of which on a yearly
occasion, about the month of October, when the
lake is made rough evidently by the autumn star,
they are massed together by the waves and rolled
in such a marvellous shoal that masses of fish, a
thousand in each, are found in the receptacles
constructed in the river for the purpose.

although all other fish have fixed breeding seasons.
Its eggs grow very quickly. Lampreys are commonly
believed to crawl out on to dry land and to be
impregnated by copulating with snakes. Aristotle
gives the name of zmyrus& to the male fish which

constellation of the Great Bear, which are of a
bright golden colour as long as the fish are alive,
and are extinguished when they are deprived of

into ponds of lampreys—not that the wild animals
on land were not sufficient for this purpose, but
