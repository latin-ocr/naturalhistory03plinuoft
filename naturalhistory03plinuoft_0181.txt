kind of association with men. Of the remaining kinds animazs.

it is agreed that birds are the smallest. We will
therefore first speak of the creatures of the seas,
rivers and ponds.

There are however a considerable number of these Remarkabce
that are larger even than land animals. The ζιζζξῗξ

obvious cause of this is the lavish nature of liquid.
Binis, which live hovering in the air, are in a different
condition. But in the sea, lying so widely outspread
and so yieldjng and productive of nutriment, because
the element receives generative causes from above
and is always producing offspring, a great many
actual monstrosities are found, the seeds and first
principles intertwining and interfolding with each
other now in one way and now in another, now by the
action of the wind and now by that of the waves‚ so
ratifying the common opinion that everything born
in any department of nature exists also in the sea,
as well as a number of things never found elsewhere.
Indeed we may realize that it contains likenesses of
things and not of animals only, when we examine the
grape, the sword-fish‚ the saw-fish, and the cucumber·
fish‚ the last resembling a real cucumber both in
colour and scent3 which makes it less surprising that
in cockle-shells that are so tiny there are horses'
heads projecting.
