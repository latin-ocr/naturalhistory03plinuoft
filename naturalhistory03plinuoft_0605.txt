are crooked in beasts of prey but straight in the
other animals, for instance dogs, excepting the nail
that in most species hangs downward from the leg.
All animals with feet have toes, except the elephant3
for the elephant's toes are unshaped and though
five in number yet undivided and only slightly
separated, and resembling hooves, not nails, and the
fore feet are larger‚ the joints of the hind feet being
short, and also an elephant’s knees bend inward
like a man's, whereas the other animals bend the
knees of the hind legs in the opposite direction to
those of the forelegs; for viviparous animals bend
their knees in front of them and the joints of the

hocks backward.

CII. In man the knees and elbows bend in opposite lm an

directions, and the same is the case with bears and
the monkey tribe, which are consequently not at
all swift. In the oviparous quadrupeds‚'the crocodile
and the lizards‚ the front knees curve backward and
the hind knees forward, but these species have legs
that bend like the human thumb3 and so also have
the multipedes, except the hindeimost legs of the
species that jump. Birds curve their wings forward
like the front legs of quadrupeds but their thigh
baekward.

CIII. The knees of a human being also possess a
sort of religious sanctity in the usage of the nations.
Suppliants touch the knees and stretch out their
hands towards them and pray at them as at altars,
perhaps because they contain a certain vital principle.
For in the actual joint of each knee, right and left,
on the front side there is a sort of twin hollow cavity,
the piercing of which, as of the throat, causes the
breath to flow away. T here is a religious sanctity
