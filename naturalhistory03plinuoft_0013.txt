NOTE ΟΝ NOMENCLATURE

In identifyiny the :ooloqical ,specics described in this volume
J am indebted for aid to my fricnd and colleaque Mr. J. T.
Saunders, who has qone throuyh the whole and qiven me tlte
modern equivalems of the Latin names ,· althouyk ke warns me
that in a qood ‘many cases tlze identification is doubtful.

There are consequently some discrepancies between the nomen-
clature in the translation here and that used in Book I, the
Table os Contents. Pliny pre3umably compiled it aster com-
pletinq tlte res! of che work ,· but as editorzal exiqencies precluded
tlte postponement of Volume I os this translation till the others
were finished, I had to be content, for Book I, with tlte renderinqs
qiven in Lemis and Short or in Bostock and Riley’s translation.
