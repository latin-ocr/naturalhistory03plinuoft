animals all those that close the eyes sleep. That
also water animals sleep at all events a little is held
even by those who doubt about the other kinds;
they do not infer this from the eyes, as these creatures
have no eyelids, but merely by their quietness: they
are seen reposing as if sunk in slumber, and only
moving their tails, and waking up in alarm at any
disturbance. It is affirmed with more confidence
about tunny-fish‚ because they sleep close to banks
or rocks3 while flatfish sleep in shallow water, so
that they are often taken out by hand. Dolphins
and whales‚ in fact, are heard actually snoring. That
insects also sleep is shown by their silence, and by
their not even being roused by having lights brought
near them.

But some children never dream, and with these we
find instances in which their dreaming contrary to
their usual habit was a sign of approaching death.
Here an important topic invites us and one fully
supplied with arguments on both sides—whether
there are certain cases of foreknowledge present in
the mind during repose, and what causes them, or
whether it is a matter of chance like most things.
If the question be argued by instantes, these would
doubtless be found to be equal on both sides. It is
practically agreed that dreams occurring directly
after drinking wine and eating food, and those that
come in dozing off to sleep a second time, are false;
but sleep is really nothing but the retirement of the
mind into its innermost sels. It is manifest that,
