BOOK VIII. xxl. 5q-xxn. 61

equally remarkable story about a panther, which out
of desire for human aid lay in the middle of a road,
where the father of a certain student of philosophy
named Philinus suddenly came in sight of it. The
man, so the story goeS, began to retreat, but the
animal rolled over on its back, obviously trying to
eajole him, and tormented by sorrow that was intel-
ligible even in a panther: she had a litter of cubs
that had fallen into a pit some distance away. The
first result of his compassion therefore was not to be
frightened‚ and the next to give her his attention3
and he followed where she drew him by lightly
touching his clothes with her elaws, and when he
understood the cause of her grief and at the same
time the recompense due for his own seeurity, he
got the cubs out of the pit; and the panther with her
young escorted him right to the edge of the desert,
guiding him with gestures of delight that made it
quite clear that she was expressing gratitude and
not reckoning on any recompense, which is rare even
in a human being.

XXII. These stories give eredibility to Demo-
critus also, who tells a tale of Thoas in Arcadia
being saved by a snake. When a boy he had fed it
and made a great pet of it, and his parent being
afraid of the snake's nature and size had taken it
away into an uninhabited region, where it recognized
Thoas’s voice and came to his reseue when he was
entrapped by an ambush of brigands. For as to the
reports about infants when they had been exposed
being fed by the milk of wild animals, as well as
those about our founders being nursed by a she-wolf,
I deem it more reasonable for them to be credited to
the grandem· of their destinies than to the natine
of tlie wild animals.
