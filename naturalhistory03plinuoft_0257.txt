the mere rattling together of the pearls3 and now-a-
days even poor people covet them—it is a common
saying that a pearl is as good as a lackey for a lady
when she walks abroad! And they even use them
on their feet, and fix them not only to the laces
of their sandals but all over their slippers. In fact,
by this time they are not content with wearing
pearls unless they tread on them, and actually walk
on these unique gems!

There used to be commonly found in our own sea,
and more frequently on the coasts of the Thracian
Bosphorus, small red gems contained in the shells
called mussels. But in Acarnania there grows what
is termed the sea—pen3 which shows that pearls are
not born in only one kind of shell, for Juba also
records that the Arabs have a shell resembling a
toothed comb‚ that bristles like a hedgehog, and has
an actual pearl, resembling a hailstone‚ in the fleshy
part3 this kind of shell is not imported to Rome.
And there are not found in Acarnania the formerly
celebrated pearls of an exceptional size and almost
a marble colour. Better ones are found round
Actium, but these too are small, and in sea-board
Mauretania. Alexander the Encyclopaedist and

Sudines think that they grow old and let their colour
evaporate.

because no fall can break thern. Also they are no
always found in the middle of the flesh, but in a
variety of places, and before now we have seen them
even at the extreme edges, as though in the act of
passing out of the shell; and in some cases we have
seen four or five pearls in one shell. In weight few
specimens have hitherto exceeded half an ounce by
