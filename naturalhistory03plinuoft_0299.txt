BOOK IX. Lxxxm. 177—Lxxxv. 180

at the outflow of the river Lycus fishes are born from
eggs left in the mud that seek their fodder by
flapping with their little gills, and this makes them not
need moisture, which is the reason why eels also live
comparatively long when taken out of the water,
while eggs mature in a dry place, for instance
tortoise's eggs. (4) In the same region of the Black
Sea the fish most frequently caught in the ice is the
goby, which is only made to reveal the movement
of life by the heat of the saucepan. These accounts
indeed, however marvellous‚ do nevertheless embody
a certain principle. The same authority reports that
in Paphlagonia earth—fish extremely acceptable for
food are dug out of deep trenches in places where
there is no ov elflow from streams; and after himself
expressing surprise at their being piopagated with—
out eoupfing, he gives the view ethat at all events
they have a supply of moisture in them similar to
that in wells—but as if fish were found in any wells!
&Vhatever the fact is as to this, it certainly makes
the life of moles, an underground animal, less re—
markable, unless perhaps these fishes also possess
the nature of earth-worms.

LXXXIV. But credibility is given to all these

statements by the flooding of the Nile, with a marvel ''²²⁶‘'

that surpasses them all: this is that, when the river
withdraws its covering, water-mice are found with the
work of generative water and earth uncompleted—
they are already alive in a part of their body, but
the most recently formed part of their structure is
still of earth.

LXXXV. Nor 1s it proper to omit the stories about
the anthias fish that I notice to have won general
acceptance. We have mentioned the Swallow
