a bird is cited in Nigidius that breaks eagles' eggs.
There are besides a number of kinds described in
Tuscan lore that have not been seen for generations,
though it is surprising that they should have now
become extinct when even kinds that are ravaged
by man 's greed continue plentiful.

races the writings of an author named Hylas are
deemed to be the most learned. He states that the
night-mvl, eagle-owl, woodpecker, trygonaa and

are turned the wrong way up by the weight of the
heads and present the hinder part of the chicks’
bodies to the mother to cherish.

XIX. Night-owls wage a crafty battle against
other birds. When surrounded by a crowd that out-

claws. Through a kind of natural alliance the hawk
comes to their aid and takes part in the war. Nigidius
relates that night-owls hibernate for 60 days every
winter, and that they have nine eries.

for instance the variety of woodpeckers called Birds
of Mars ¹⁷ that are important in taking auguries. In
this class are the tree-hollowing woodpeckers that
climb nearly straight upright in the manner of cats,
but also the others that cling upside down, which know

there is fodder underneath it. They are the only
birds that rear their chicks in holes. There is a
common belief ⁶ that when wedges are driven into

their holes by a shepherd the birds by applying a
