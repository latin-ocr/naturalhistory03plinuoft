go away towards the right hand side the offspring
will be males, and if towards the left, females.
Conception is effected by one coupling, and if this
happens to miss, the female goes to a male again
twenty days after. They bear the calf in the tenth
month; one produced before is of no use. Some
authorities say that they bear on the actual last day
of the tenth month. They rarely produce twins.
Coupling takes place in the thirty days following
the rise of the Dolphin on J anuary 4, and occasionally
in the autumn also, though nations that live on milk
spread it out so that there may be a supply of this
nutriment at every season of the year. Bulls do
not couple more than twice in one day. Oxen are
the only animals that graze even while walking
backward3 indeed among the Garamantes that is
their only way of grazing. The longest life of a cow
is 15 years and of a bull 20 ; they grow to full strength
at 5. Washing in hot water is said to fatten them,
and also cutting a hole in the hide and blowing air
into the flesh with a reed. Even the breeds less
praised for their appearance are not to be deemed
inferior: the Alpine cows which are the smallest in
size give most milk, and do most work, although they
are yoked by the head and not the neck. Syrian
oxen have no dewlaps, but a hump on the back.
Also the Carian breed in a district of Asia is said to
be ugly in appearance, with a swelling that projects
from the neck over the shoulders and with the horns
displaced‚but excellent in work—although when black
and white in colour they are said to be no good for
ploughing3 the bulls have smaller and thinner horns
than the cows. Oxen should be broken when three
