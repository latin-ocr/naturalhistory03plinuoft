XLIII. The river Bug on the Black Sea at Θ 2 ὁ

midsummer brings down some thin membranes that ·

look like berries out of which burst a four-legged
caterpillar in the manner of the creature mentioned
above, but it does not live beyond one day, owing
to which it is called the hemerobius.a The rest of
this sort of creatures have from start to finish seven-
day periods, but the gnat and maggots have twenty-
one-day‚ and those whose offspring are fully formed
twenty-eight-day periods. Their changes and trans-
formations into other shapes take place every three
or every four days. The remaining kinds of this
class possessing wings usually die in autumn of decay
of the wings,‘⁷ but horse-flies die of blindness also.
When flies have been killed by damp they can be
resuscitated by being buricd in ashes.

bushy tufts, the bird of Stymphalusc a erest, the
pheasant little horns‚ as moreover has the small
bird that was formerly named from this peculiarity
the crestcd lark and subsequently was called by the
