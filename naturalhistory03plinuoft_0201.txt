but then too they suddenly hasten to the spot, in
order to give their aid. Their line of battle comes
into view, and at once deploys in the place where
they are to join battle3 they bar the passage on the
side of the sea and drive the scared mullet into the
shallows. Then the fishermen put their nets round
them and lift them out of the water with forks.
None the less the pace of some mullets leaps
over the obstacles; but these are caught by the
dolphins, which are satisfied for the time being with
merely having killed them, postponing a meal till
victory is won. The action is hotly contested, and
the dolphins pressing on with the greatest bravery are
delighted to be caught in the nets, and for fear that
this itself may hasten the enemy’s flight, they glide
out between the boats and the nets or the swimrning
fishermen so gradually as not to open ways of escape ;
none of them try to get away by leaping out of
the water, which otherwise they are very fond of
doing, unless the nets are put below them. One that
gets out thereupon carries on the battle in front
of the rampart. When in this way the catch has
been completed they tear in pieces the fish that
they have killed. But as they are aware that they
have had too strenuous a task for only a single day’s
pay they wait there till the following day, and are
given a seed of bread mash dipped in wine, in addition
to the fish.
