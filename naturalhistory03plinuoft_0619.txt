trumpet sound. In oxen alone the lowing of the
females is louder, but in every other kind of animal
the females' voice is not so loud as that of the males,
even (in the case of the human race) those that have
been castrated. The infant gives no sound at birth
until it emerges entirely from the womb. It begins
to talk when a year old3 but Croesus had a son who
spoke at six months and while still at the rattle stage,
a portent that brought the whole of that realm to

There are other facts besides about the voice that
deserve mention. It is absorbed by the sawdust or

all over the world, and of all the tunes and modulations
and inflexions‚ but before all things of the power of
expressing the thoughts that has made us different
from the beasts‚ and has also caused another dis-
