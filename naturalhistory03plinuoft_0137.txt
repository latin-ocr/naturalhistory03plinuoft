LXIX. A mare coupled with an ass after twelve ff'r'gffissny
months bears a mule, an animal of exceptional ’ ’
strength for agricultural operations. To breed
mules they choose mares not less than four or more
than ten years old. Also breeders say that females
of either genus refuse stallions of the other one unless
as foals they were suckled by females of the same
genus as the stallions; for this reason they stealthily
remove the foals in the dark and put them to mares'
or she-asses' udders respectively. But a mule is
also got by a horse out of an ass, though it is
unmanageabk, slow and obstinate. Also all the
foals from old mares are sluggish. It causes mis-
carriage for a mare in foal by a horse to be put
to an ass, but not vice versa. It has been observed
that female asses are best coupled six days after they
have borne a soal, and that males couple better when
tired. It is noticed that a female that does not
conceive before she casts what are called her milk-
teeth is barren, as is one that does not begin to
produce foals from the first coupling. Male foals
of an ass by a horse were in old days called hinnies‚
while the term mules was used for the foals of a mare
by an ass. It has been noticed that the offspring of
two different races of animals belong to a third kind
and resemble neither parent3 and that such hybrids
are not themselves fertile: this is the case with all
kinds of animab, and is the reason why mules are
barren. A number of cases of reproduction by cases os

mules are recorded in our Annals, but these were ζῇἵῖζζιμη
