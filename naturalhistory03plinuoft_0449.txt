BOOK XI

I. There remain some creatures of immeasurably Insects:
minute structurea —in fact some authorities havesshn 5} Μ’ hm
stated that they do not breathe and also that they Ἓξ “gam—71³
are actually devoid of blood. These are of great ame> ana '
number and of many kinds; they have the habits ⁸²²⁷²⁹⁸
of land-animals and of flying animals‚ some lacking
wings, for instance centipedes‚²’ others winged‚ for
instance bees, others of both kinds, for instance ants,
some lac-king both wings and feet3 and all are rightly
termed insects, from the incisions which encirele
them in some cases in the region of their necks and
in others of their chests and stomach and separate
off their limbs, these being only connected by a thin
tube, with some however the crease of the incision
not entirely encircling them, but only at the belly
or higher up, with flexible vertebrae shaped like
gutter-tiles-—showing a craftsmanship on the part
of Nature that is more remarkable than in any other
case: inasmuch as in large bodies or at all events
the larger ones the process of manufacture was
facilitated by the yielding nature of the material,
whereas in these minute nothings what method,
what power, what labyrinthine perfection is dis-
played! Where did Nature find a place in a flea
for all the senses ?-—and other smaller creatures
can be mentioned‚—but at what point in its surface

did she place sight? where did she attach taste?
