BOOK XI. mn. 160-Lx11. 163

LXI. There are three kinds of teeth——serrated or Th mm.
continuous or projecting: serrated teeth closing to-
gether like the teeth of a comb, so as not to be worn
away by direct collision, as in snakes, fishes and dogs;
continuous‚ as in man and the horse· , proj ecting, as in
the boar, hippopotamus and elephant. Of continu-
ous teeth those that separate the food (incisors),
are called the broad or sharp teeth, those
that masticate it double teeth‚ and those be-
tween these dog-teeth. The latter are longest in
creatures with serrated teeth. Continuous teeth
are either in both jaws, as with the horse, 01· else there
are no front teeth in the upper jaw, 35 with oxen and
sheep and all the ruminants. The goat has no upper
teeth except the pair in front. Species having
serrated teeth have no projecting teeth‚ and a female
rarely has them, and when she has them does not use
them3 consequently though boars gore, sows bite.
No species with horns has projecting teeth, but all
have eux-ved ones; all the other species have solid
teeth. All kinds of fish have serrated teeth except
the parrot-fish—-this is the only aquatic species that
1135 level teeth. Many ofthem however have teeth on
the tongue and 311 over the mouth, so as to soften by
means of a multiplicity of wounds obJects that they
are unable to reduce by mastication. Many also
have teeth on the palate [and also on the tail‚]‘² and
also turned further into the mouth, so as to prevent
morsels of food from falling out, 35 they have no
apparatus for retaining it.

LXII. The asp and serpent have similar teeth‚T71eeteehoJ
but two extremely long ones on the right and left Ῥρεῖζᾟζω
side of the upper jaw, perforated by a slender tube
like the stings of the scorpion, which inject poison.
