continues feeding its chicks for some time even when
they can fly; (XV) whereas all the other birds of the
same class drive their chicks out of the nests and
eompel them to fly, as also do ravens. These not
only seed on flesh themselves too, but also drive away
their chicks when strong to a considerable distance.
Consequently in small villages there are not more
than two pairs of ravens, and in fact in the neigh-
bourhood of Crannon in Thessaly there is one pair
permanently in each place; the parents retire to
make room for their offspring.

There are certain points of difference between this
bird and the one mentioned above. Ravens breed
before midsummer, also they have 60 days of ill-
health, principally owing to thirst, before the figs
ripen in the autumn3 whereas the crow is seized
with sickness from that day onward.

Ravens produce broods of five at most. There is a
popular belief that they lay eggs, or else mate, with
the beak (and that consequently if women with child
eat a raven’s egg they bear the infant through the
mouth, and that altogether they have a difficult
delivery if raven’s eggs are brought into the house);
but Aristotle says that this is not true of the raven, any
more indeed than it is of the ibis in Egypt, but that
the billing in question (which is often noticed) is a
form of kissing, like that which takes place between
pigeons. Ravens seem to be the only birds that
have an understanding of the meanings that they
convey in auspices; for when the guests of Medus
were murdered, all the ravens in the Peloponnese
and Attica flew away.“ It is a specially bad omen
when they gulp down their croak as if they were
choking.
