BOOK X. Lv1. 115—LVI11. 117

LVI. Birds' dispositions also are equally varied, ᾇξῖξξζζά
especially in respect of food. Those called goat· the snm-ener-
suckers, which resemble a rather large blaekbird, ξῇζᾶξζζῑέἀθδ
are night thieves-for they cannot see in the daytime.

They enter the shepherds’ stalls and fly to the goats'
udders in order to suck their milk, which injures the
udder and makes it perish‚ and the goats they have
milked in this way gradually go blind.a There is a
bird called the shoveller-duck which flies up to the
sea-divers and seizes their heads in its bill till it
wrings their catch from them. The same bird after
filling itself by swallowing shells brings them up
again when digested by the warmth of the belly and
so picked out from them ’che edible parts, discarding

the shells.

ritual: after laying an egg they begin to shiver and other birds.
shake, and purify themselves by circling round, and
make use of a straw as a ceremonia] rod to cleanse
themselves and the eggs. The smallestb of birds, the
goldfinches‚ perform their leader’s orders, not only
with their song but by using their feet and beak
instead of hands. One bird in the Arles district,
called the bull-birdc although really it is small in size‚
imitates the bellowing of oxen. Also the bird ‘1 whose
Greek name is ‘ flower,’ when driven away from
feeding on grass by the arrival of horses, imitates
their neighing, in this way taking its revenge.

LVIII. Above all, birds imitate the human voice, ἶζζξέζζθ

parrots indeed actually talking. India sends us this

body is green, only varied by a red circlet at the neck.
It greets its masters,⁹ and repeats words given to it,
being particularly sportive over the wine. Its head
