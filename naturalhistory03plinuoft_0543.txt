The most learned authorities state that the eyes are
connected with the brain by a vein; for my own part
I am inclined to believe that they are also thus

name of One-eye that used to be given to persons
born blind in one eye, and that of Eyelet given to
persons both of whose eyes were small3 the One-eye
