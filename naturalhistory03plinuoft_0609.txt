same animals have no pastern-bone‚ but those with
cloven hooves have one. Pastern-bones are also
lacking in animals having toes, and no animal has
them in the forefeet. The camel's pastern-bones
resemble those of the ox but are a little smaller3 for
the camel's foot is divided in two by a very small
cleft, and is fleshy at the tread like a bear’s‚ for which
reason a camel's feet are liable to split on too long a
journey without shoeing.

CVI. Only with animals of the d1 auoht kind do the
hooves grow again. In some placest> in Illyria pigsp
have solid hooves. Horned animals mostly have
cloven hooves. No species has both solid hooves
and two horns3 the only animal with one horn is the
rhinoceros, and the only one with one horn and
cloven hooves the antelope. The rhinoceros is the
only solid-hooved animal that has pastcrn-bones,
for pigs are thought to belong to both classes, and
consequently their pastern—bones are mis—shapen.
Persons who have thought that a human being has
pastern-bones have been easily rcfuted. Of the
animals with toes only the lynx has something
resembling a pastern-bone, and the lion a still more
twisted one. But the true pastern-bone is at the
ankle-joint, projecting with a hollow bulge and
attached with a ligature onto the joint.

CVII. Some birds have toes, others are web-
footed, and others intermediate‚ with separate toes
but also broad feet3 but all have four toes, three in
front and one at the beel—the latter however absent
in some long-legged species3 the wry-neck alone
has two toes on either side of the foot. The same
bird has a tongue like a snake's which it stretches
out a long way, and it turns its neck round towards
