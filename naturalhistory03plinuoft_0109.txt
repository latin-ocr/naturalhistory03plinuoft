BOOK VIII. mv. 129-Lv. 132

called wake—robin to loosen the bowels‚ which are
otherwise constipated‚ and they rub their teeth on
tree-stumps to get their mouths into training. Their
eyes have got dim, which is the chief reason why
they seek sor hives‚ so that their face may be stung
by the bees to relieve that trouble with blood. A
bear's weakest part is the head, which is the lion's
strongest; consequently if when hard pressed by an
attack they are going to fling themselves down from
a rock they make the jump with their head covered
with their fore paws, and in the arena are often
killed by their head being broken by a buffet. The
Spanish provinces believe that a bear’s brain contains
poison, and when bears are killed in shows their heads
are burnt in the presence of a witness, on the ground
that to drink the poison drives a man bear-mad. Bears
even walk on two feet, and they crawl down trees
backward. They tire out bulls with their weight by
hanging by all four feet from their mouth and horns;
and no other animal's stupidity is more cunning in
doing harm. It is noted in the Annals that on 19 Sep-
tember in the consulship α of Marcus Piso and Marcus
Messala, Domitius Ahenobarbus as curule aedile
provided in the circus a hundred Numidian bears
and the same number of Ethiopian huntsmen. Ι
am surprised at the description of the bears as
Numidiam since it is known that the bear does not
occur in Africa.

LV. The mice of the Black Sea region also hibernate,
at all events the white ones, which are stated to have
a very discriminating palate, though Ι am curious to
know how the authorities detected this. Alpine
mice‚⁶ which are the size of badgers‚ also hibernate,
but these carry a supply of fodder into their caves
