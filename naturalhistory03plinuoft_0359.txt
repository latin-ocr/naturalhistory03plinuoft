in the adjacent region of the Insubrians, do not
come within eight miles of Lake Como. It is
said that Mars's woodpecker is not found in the
district of Taranto. The kinds of pie called chequered
pies and distinguished for their long tail, though
hitherto rare, have lately begun to be seen between
the Apennines and Rome ; this bird has the peculiarity
of moulting its feathers yearly at the time when the
turnip is sown. Partridges do not fly across the
frontier of Boeotia into Attica3 nor does any bird
fly across the temple dedicated to Achilles on the
islanda of the Black Sea where he is buried. In
the district of Fidenae near Rome storks do not
hateh chicks or make nests. But a quantity of
pigeons every year fly from the sea to the district
of Volterra. Neither flies nor dogs enter the temple
of Hercules in the Cattle-market at Rome. There
are many similar facts besides, which Ι am continually
careful to omit in my account of the several kinds,
to avoid being wearisome—for example Theophrastus
states that even pigeons and peacocks and ravens
are not indigenous in Asia nor croaking frogs in
Cyrenaica.

only cranes do, for these grow black in old age.
The blackbird changes from black to red3 and it
sings in the summer, and chirps in winter, but at
midsummer is silent; also the beak of yearling
blackbirds, at all events the cocks, is turned to ivory
colour. Thi-ushes are of a speckled colour round the
neck in summer but sels-coloured in winter.
