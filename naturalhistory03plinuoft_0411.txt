BOOK X. Lxxxx. 158-161

pigeon sits from noon till the next morning and the
cock the rest of the time. Pigeons always lay a
male and a female egg, the male first and the female
a day later. In this speeies both birds sit, the cock
in the daytime and the hen at night. They hatch m
about three weeks‚ and they lay four days after
mating. In summer indeed they sometimes produce
three pairs of chickens every two months, for they
hatch on the 17111α day and breed immediately3
consequently eggs are often found among the
ehickens, and some are beginning to fly just when
others are breaking the egg. Then the chicks them-
selves begin laying when five months old. However
in the absence of a cock hen birds actually mate with
one another indifferently, and produce unfertile
eggs from which nothing is produced, which the
Greeks call wind· -eggs.

The peahen begins to lay when three months Maria ιιο]
01(1. Ι11 the first year it lays one egg or a second ²²9⁰oe ⁷⁴⁸·
one, but 111 the following year four or five at a time,
and 111 the remaining years twelve at a time, but not
more, with intervals of two or three days between
the eggs, and three times in the year, provided that
the eggs are put under farmyard hens to sit on. The
male Cpeaeock breaks the eggs, out of desire for the
female sitting on them; consequently the hen bird
lays at night, and in hiding or when perching on a
high place—and unless the eggs are caught on a bed
of straw they are broken. One cock ean serve five
hens, and when there have been only one or two
hens for each cock their fertility is spoiled by its
salaciousness. The chiekens are hatched in 27 days
01· at latest on the 29th.
