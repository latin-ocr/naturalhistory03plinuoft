BOOK IX. vl. 16-18

creatures in the sea also breathe‚ those whose
internal organs include a lung‚ since it is thought that
no animal is able to breathe without one. Those
who hold this opinion believe that the fishes possess-
ing gills do not alternately expire and inspire air,
and that many other classes even lacking gills do not
—an opinion which I notice that Aristotle α held and
supported by many learned researches.⁶ Nor do I
pretend that I do not myself immediately accept this
view of theirs‚⁶ since it is possible that animals may
also possess other respiratory organs in place of
lungs, if nature so wills, just as also many possess
another fluid instead of blood. At all events who
can be surprised that this life-giving breath pene-
trates into water if he observes that it is also given
back again from the water, and that it also pene-
trates into the earth, that much denser element, as is
proved by animals that live always in underground
burrows, like moles? Undoubtedly to my mind
there are additional facts that make me believe
that in fact all creatures in the water breathe, owing
to the condition of their own nature—in the first
place a sort of panting that has often been noticed in
fishes during the summer heat, and another form of
gasping‚ so to speak, in calm weather, and also the
admission in regard to fishes sleeping made even by
those persons who are of the opposite opinion—for
how can sleep occur without breathing ?-and more-
over the bubbles caused on the surface of the water
by air rising from below, and the effect of the moon
in causing the bodies even of shellfish to increase in
size. Above all there is the fact that it will not be
doubted that fish have the sense of hearing and smell,
both of which are derived from the substance of air:
