off speeimens of either kind before they have wings,
they serve as very acceptable food for their mothers.

As time goes on they give them drops of food and Hatchinyos
sit on them, buzzing more than at any other time, ΨΜ

with the object, it is thought, of producing the
warmth needed for hatching out the grubs, until
they break the membranes that enclose each of them
like eggshells and the whole band emerges. This
was observed at Rome on the suburban estate of a
certain fex—consul, who had hives made of the
transparent horn of a lantern. The brood grows up
in about six weeks. In some hives what is called a
wart is formed, a hard lump of bitter wax, when the
bees have not produced offspring out of the comb,
owing to disease or sloth ox· natural infertility3 this
is the bees' form of abortion. But as soon as they
are hatched out they get to work with their mothers
under some sort of tuition, and the youthful king is

escorted by a retinue of his peers. Several kings saecum ο]
are begun to be produced, so that there may not be sumre “¹⁷²9

a lack of them; but afterwards, when the offspring
sprung from these has begun to be grown up, by a
unanimous vote they kill the worst of them so that
they may not divide up the forces. They are of two
kinds, the better sort red and the inferior kind black
or speekled, All of them are always exceptionally
well-formed and twice as large as the others; their
wings are shorter, their legs straight, their bearing
more lofty, and they have a spot on their brow that
shines white in a kind of fillet3 they also differ from
the common herd a great deal by their brilliant colour.
