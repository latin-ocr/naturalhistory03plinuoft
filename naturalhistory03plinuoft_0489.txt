BOOK XI. xx. 64-xx1. 67

when they do not fill the combs full, it is called claron,
and blapsigonia a if they do not bring their offspring
to maturity.

XXI. Also an echo is detiimental to bees with its En nequ eso]
repercussion that alarms them by striking them withb‘ da anq'er ⁰⁰²⁶*
an alteinating blow; fog too is detrimental. Also

spiders aie in the highest deglee hostile· ‚ when

they have succeeded in weaving a web over the
combs they kill the grubs. Even the moth, ὓ that
cowardly and ignoble creature that flutteis up to
lamps when they are lit, brings disaster, and not in
one way only, for it both devours the combs itself and
leaves excrement from which grubs are produced3
also wherever it walks it weaves a covering of cobwebs
chiefly made from the down on its wings. Moreover
moths are born in the wood itself that specially
attack the combs. And another bane is their greed
sor food, as their belly is moved, specially in the
spring time, by their devouring a surfeit of flowers.
Olive oil indeed kills not only bees but all insects,
especially if they are placed in the sun after their
head has been anointed. Sometimes also they
themselves cause their own death, by greedily
devouring honey when they perceive that it is being
taken away, whereas normally they are extremely
thrifty and make a practice of driving away wasteful
and greedy bees just the same as lazy and slothful
oneS. Also their own honey is noxious to them, and
if it is smeared on their backs they die. To so many
foes and so many disasters——and how small a fraction
of them I am recounting l—-is this beneficent creature
exposed. The remedies we will speak of in their
proper places; for at present we are discussing their
nature.
