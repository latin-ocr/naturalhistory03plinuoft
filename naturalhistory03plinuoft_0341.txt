Boeotians that famous victory a against the Spartans,
conjecture thus interpreting the sign because this
bird when conquered does not crow.

XXV. Cocks when gelt stop crowing3 the opera-
tion is performed in two ways—by searing with a
gloning iron either the loins or the bottom parts
of thes legs, and then smearing the wound with
potter’ s clay. This operation makes them easier to
fatten. At Pergamum every year a public show is
given of cocks fighting like gladiators. It is found
in the Annals that in the consulship ὸ of Marcus
Lepidus and Quintus Catulus, at the country house
of Galerius in the Rimini district, a farmyard cock
spoke—the only occasion, so far as Ι know, on which
this has occurred.

XXVI. The goose also keeps a careful watch, as is
evidenced by its defence of the Capitol ⁶ during the
time when our fortunes were being betrayed by the
silence of the dogs3 for which reason food for
the geese is one of the first contracts arranged by the
censors. Moreover there is the story of the goose
at Aegium that fell in love with the supremely
beautiful boy Amphilochus of Olenus, and also
the goose that loved Glauce, the girl that played
the harp for King Ptolemy‚ whom at the same time
also a ram is said to have 'fallen 1n love with. These
birds may possibly be thought also to possess the
power of understanding wisdom: thus there is a story
that a goose attached itselfcontinually as a companion
to the philosopher Lacydes, never leaving his side
by night or day, either in public or at the baths.

goose by the excellence of its liver. Stuffing the
