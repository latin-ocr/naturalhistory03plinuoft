any fish that have received a shock while swim-
ming carelessly above her. No tendet· morsel is
preferred to the liver of this fish. The sea-frog
called the angler—fish is equally cunning: it stirs up
the mud and puts out the little horns that project
under its eyes, drawing thern back when little fishes
frisk towards them till they come near enough for it
to spring upon them, In a similar manner the skate
and the turbot while in hiding put out their fins and
wave them about to look like worms‚ and so also do
the fish called rays. For the sting—ray acts as a
freebooter, from its hiding place transfixing fish
passing by with its sting, which is its weapon3 there
are proofs of this cunning, because these fish, though
the slowest there are, are found with mullet, the
swiftest of all fish, in their belly.

The scolwendmfl which resembles the land animal
called the centipede, when it has swallowed a hook
vomits up the whole of its inwards until it succeeds in
disgorging it, and then sucks them back again. Sea-
foxes b on the other hand in a similar emergency gulp
down more of the line till they reach its weak part
where they may easily gnaw it off. The fish called the
catfish more cautiously nibbles at hooks from behind
and strips them of the bait without swallowing them.

The sea-ram ⁶ goes around like a brigand, and now
hides in the shadow of the larger vessels riding at
anchor and waits in case somebody may be tempted
by the pleasure of a swim‚ now raises its head out of
the water and watches for fishermen‘s boats, and
secretly swimming up to them sinks them.
