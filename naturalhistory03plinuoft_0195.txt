for 30 days about the rising of the dog-star and hide
themselves in an unknown manner, which is the more
surprising in view of the fact that they cannot breathe
under water. They have a habit of sallying out on
to the land for an unascertained reason, and they do
not die at once after touching earth—in fact they die
much more quickly if the gullet is closed up. The
dolphin’s tongue, unlike the usual structure of
aquatic animals‚ is mobile, and is short and broad,
not unlike a pig’s tongue. For a voice they have a
moan like that of a human being3 their back is
arched‚ and their snout turned up, owing to which all
of them in a surprising manner answer to the name of
‘ Snubnose ’ and like it better than any other.

VIII. The dolphin is an animal that is not only
friendly to mankind but is also a lover of music2
and it can be charmed by singing in harmony, but
particularly by the sound of the water-organ. It is
not afraid of a human being as something strange to
it, but comes to meet vessels at sea and sports and
gambols round them, actually trying to race them and
passing them even when under full sail. In the reign
of the late lamented Augustus a dolphin that had been
brought into the Lucrine Lake fellmarvellously in love
with a certain boy, a poor man’s son, who used to go
from the Baiae district to school at Pozzuoli‚ because
fairly often the lad when loitering about the place at
noon called him to him by the name of Snubnose and
coaxed him with bits of the bread he had with him
for the journey‚—-I should be ashamed to tell the
story were it not that it has been written about by
Maecenas and Fabianus and Flavius Alfius and
many others,—-and when the boy called to it at what-
ever time of day, although it was concealed in hiding
