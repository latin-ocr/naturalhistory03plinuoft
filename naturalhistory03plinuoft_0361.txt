XLIII. Nightingales pour out a ceaseless gush of ,⁷⁹¹2 niqht·
song for fifteen days and nights on end when the buds ζ’ἇξιῖξᾶηᾱ
of the leaves are swelling-zt bird not in the lowest variety os
rank remarkable. In the first place there is so loud ²⁶⁸ sonq.
a voice and so persistent a supply of breath in such
a tiny little body3 then there is the consummate
knowledge of music in a single bird: the sound is
given out with modulations, and now is drawn out
into a long note with one continuous breath, now
varied by managing the breath‚ now made staccato
by checking it, or linked together by prolonging
it, or carried on by holding it back3 or it is suddenly
lowered, and at times sinks into a mere murmur, loud,
10w‚‘1 bass, treble, with trills, with long notes, modu-
lated when this seems good—soprano, mezzo, bari-
tone; and briefly all the devices in that tiny throat
which human science has devised with all the elabor-
ate mechanism of the flute, so that there can be no
doubt that this sweetness was foretold by a con-
vincing omen when it made music on the lips of the
infant Sfesichorusst And that no one may doubt
its being a matter of science, the birds have several
songs each, and not all the same but every bird songs
of its own. They compete with one another, and
there is clearly an animated rivalry between them;
the loser often ends her life by dying, her breath
giving out before her song. Other younger birds
practise their music, and are given verses to imitate3
the pupil listens with close attention and repeats
the phrase, and the two keep silence by turns: we
notice improvement in the one under instruction
and a sort of criticism on the part of the instmctoess.
Consequently they fetch the prices that are given Tradein

for slaves, and indeed larger prices than were paid ξζῗῶζξξῇθαιω
