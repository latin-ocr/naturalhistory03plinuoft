BOOK XI. ιν. 12-v. 15

so mighty a power that out of what is almost a tiny
ghost of an animal she has created something
incomparable l What sinews or muscles can we
match with such efficacy and industry as that of
the bees? What men, I protest, can we rank in
rationality with these insects, which unquestionably
excel mankind in this, that they recognize only
the common interest? Not raising the question of
breath, suppose we agree as to their possessing even
blood ; yet what a tiny quantity can there be in these

whence could they obtain strength to endure srost and ⁰f ⁶³⁹⁸·
snow and the blasts of the north wind ?-all species
alike, no doubt, but not for so long a period the ones
that hide in our house-walls and are warmed earlier
than others are. In regard to bees, either seasons
or else climates have changed, or previous writers

cells, then produce offspring, and afterwards honey‚
wax from flowers‚ bee-glue from the droppings of
the gum-producing trees—the sap, glue and resin
of the willow, elm and reed. They first smear the
whole interior of the hive itself with these as with
a kind of stucco, and then with other bitterer juices
