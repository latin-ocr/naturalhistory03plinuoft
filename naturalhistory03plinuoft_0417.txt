gnaws it off. The viper is the only land animal that
bears eggs inside it; they are of one colour and sofr,
like fishes' roe. After two days she hatches the
young inside her uterus, and then bears them at the
rate of one a day, to the number of about twenty ; the
consequence is that the remaining ones get so tired
of the delay that they burst open their mother's
sides, so committing matricide. All the other kinds
of snakes incubate their eggs in a clutch on the
ground, and hatch out the young in the following year.
Crocodiles take turns to incubate‚ male and female.
But let us give an account of the mode of repro-
duction of the remaining land animals as well.

Man is the only animal with which mating for the gaggam

triumph, selected for a competition in it a certain
maid who was the most notorious of the professional
prostitutes‚ and beat her iu a twenty-four hours’
match, with a score of twenty-five. In the human
race the males have devised every out-of-the—way
form of sexual indulgence, crimes against nature,
but the females have invented abortion. How much
more guilty are we in this department than the
wild animals! Hesiodc has stated that men have
stronger sexual appetites in winter and women in

Summer-
